[Brackets] enclose editorial explanations. Small ·dots· enclose material that has been added, but can be read as
though it were part of the original text. Occasional •bullets, and also indenting of passages that are not quotations,
are meant as aids to grasping the structure of a sentence or a thought. Every four-point ellipsis . . . . indicates the
omission of a brief passage that seems to present more difﬁculty than it is worth. Longer omissions are reported
between brackets in normal-sized type.—The division into Parts is not in the original, and is purely for ease
of management on this website.—The section-headings are not in the original. Each marks the start of a new
topic but not necessarily the end of the preceding one.—This work was written in 1790, three years before the
executions of the French king and queen and the ‘reign of terror’ that followed.—In the last paragraph of this
work Burke says that his life has been mainly ‘a struggle for the liberty of others’. So it was. His opposition to
the French revolution was one of the four main political battles in his life, the other three being support for the
American colonists, for the Irish, and for the people of India (see page 25).

Reﬂections on the Revolution in France

Edmund Burke

Glossary

artiﬁcial: Resulting from human intelligence and skill.
Antonym of ‘natural’; not in the least dyslogistic.
assignat:
‘Promissory note issued by the revolutionary
government of France on the security of State lands’. (OED)
bull: papal edict. Burke’s application of this term to Price’s
sermon is one of several mocking indications that he thinks
Price is pontiﬁcating like a Pope, an ‘archpontiff’.
cabal: Small plotting group.
description: This used to have as one of its meanings ‘kind’
or ‘type’ or ‘class’, and in Burke’s usage it usually means
‘kind (etc.) of men’. For example, on page 19: ‘the various
descriptions of which your community was composed’.
dissenter: Adherent of a protestant denomination other
than the Church of England.
emolument: Income by virtue of work or position; salary.
entailed inheritance: Inheritance of property that passes
down the family line and is forbidden by law to go anywhere
else.
estate: see states.
job: ‘A public service or position of trust turned to private or
party advantage’ (OED).
levity: Unseriousness.
manly: Upright.
meretricious: Glittery and cheaply decorative (from Latin
meretrix = ‘prostitute’).
mess-john: Scottish slang term for ‘priest’.

Old Jewry: A street in central London. The meeting-house
in it for dissenters was famous.
orders: see states.
parlements: Courts of justice and tribunals.
pecuniary: Having to do with money.
popular: Here it means ‘of the people’, and doesn’t imply
‘liked by the people’.
positive law: Man-made law (in contrast with natural law).
Similarly (on pages 11–12) ‘positive authority’, ‘positive insti-
tution’.
prejudice: A preconceived or long-held opinion, not neces-
sarily concerning race, sex, etc.
prescription: The legal doctrine that something’s being in
effect for long enough eventually creates a right to it—e.g.
a public path through private land. Burke’s concern here
is with prescription as a basis of ownership—e.g. a family
that has had the use and control of a landed estate for
centuries thereby owns it–and as a basis for the legitimacy
of a government, something that ‘through long usage mellows
into legality governments that started in violence’ (page 90).
prince: As was common in his day, Burke often uses ‘prince’
to mean ‘monarch’.
principle: On pages 4, 26, 28, and a number of other places
Burke uses this word in a now-obsolete sense in which it
means ‘source’, ‘cause’, ‘driver’, ‘energiser’, or the like.
revolution: When Burke speaks of ‘our revolution’ or ‘the
glorious revolution’ he is referring to the events of 1688
in which James II was replaced by the Dutch William and

Reﬂections on the Revolution in France

Edmund Burke

Mary of Orange as joint sovereigns of England. (William was
invited in by many powerful people; he came with an army,
but had no need to use it.) Before William and Mary were
crowned, arrangements and agreements were made which
had the effect of establishing a constitutional monarchy.
sentiment: This can mean ‘feeling’ or ‘belief’, and when
certain early modern writers speak of ‘moral sentiments’
they may mean both at once, or be exploiting the word’s
ambiguity. On page 42 Burke speaks of ‘a mixture of opinion
and sentiment’, which clearly treats sentiment as feeling.
sophistry: Tricky and deceptive logic.
states: The three segments of the French nation: the clergy,

the nobility, and the common people. Burke also calls them
‘estates’ and ‘orders’.

States-General: A French advisory parliament in three
assemblies for the three ‘states’ of the French nation (see
preceding entry). As the Revolution developed, the three
were merged into one, the National Assembly, and went from
being merely advisory to having legislative and executive
power.

Third Estate: The ‘common people’ part of the States-
General.

tolerable: reasonable, allowable, fairly acceptable.

Part 1

Why this work has the form of a letter

The following Reﬂections had their origin in a correspondence
between myself and a very young gentleman in Paris who
did me the honour of wanting my opinion on the important
transactions that then so much occupied the attention of
all men and have done so ever since.
I wrote an answer
some time in October 1789, but for prudential reasons didn’t
send it. That letter is mentioned at the start of the following
pages, and has been since forwarded to the person to whom
it was addressed. In a short letter to the same gentleman I
explained the delay in sending it. He responded with a new
and pressing application for my sentiments [see Glossary].

I began a second and more full discussion of the subject,
and had some thoughts of publishing it early last spring. But
as I worked on it I found that what I had undertaken was
going to be far too long for a letter, and that its importance
required a more detailed consideration than I had time to
give it. However, having thrown down my ﬁrst thoughts in
the form of a letter, and having begun this intending it to
be a private letter, I found it difﬁcult to change the form
of address when my sentiments had grown into a greater
extent and had turned in another direction. I am aware that
a different plan might be more favourable to a commodious
division and distribution of what I have to say.

Part 1

The Revolution Society

Dear Sir, You are pleased to ask again, with some earnest-
ness, for my thoughts on recent events in France. I shan’t
give you reason to imagine that I think my sentiments are so
valuable that I want to be asked for them. They are of too
little consequence to be very anxiously either communicated
or withheld. . . . In the ﬁrst letter I had the honour to write to
you, which at length I send, I wrote neither for or from any
description [see Glossary] of men, nor shall I in this letter. My
errors, if any, are my own. My reputation alone is to answer
for them.

The long letter I have already sent you shows you that
though I heartily wish that France may be animated by a
spirit of rational liberty, and that I think you are bound in
all honest policy to provide •a permanent body in which that
spirit may reside and •an effective organ by which it may act,

it is my misfortune to have great doubts regarding several
important aspects of your recent doings.

When you wrote last, you thought I might be counted
among those who approve of certain proceedings in France,
because of the solemn public seal of approval they have
received from two clubs of gentlemen in London—the Consti-
tutional Society and the Revolution Society.

I have the honour to belong to several clubs in which
the •constitution of this kingdom and the •principles of the
glorious revolution [see Glossary] are held in high reverence,
and I count myself among the most forward in my zeal
for maintaining that constitution and those principles in
their utmost purity and vigour. It is because I do so that I
think it necessary that there should be no mistake ·about
what this zeal involves·. Those who cultivate the memory of
our revolution and are attached to the constitution of this
kingdom will take good care not to get involved with the

persons who, under the pretext of zeal toward the revolution
and the constitution, often wander from their true principles
and are ready on every occasion to depart from the ﬁrm but
cautious and deliberate spirit that produced the revolution
and that presides in the constitution. Before addressing the
more substantial matters in your letter, I shall give you what
information I have been able to obtain concerning the two
clubs that have taken it upon themselves to interfere in the
concerns of France. I start by assuring you that I am not
and never have been a member of either.

The ﬁrst, calling itself the Constitutional Society or Soci-
ety for Constitutional Information or some such title, is seven
or eight years old, I believe. This society appears to have a
purpose that is charitable, and to that extent praiseworthy.
It was established for the circulation, at the expense of
the members, of many books that few others would spend
money on and that might lie on the hands of the publishers,
causing great loss to that useful body of men. Whether
these charitably circulated books were ever as charitably
read is more than I know. Possibly several of them have been
exported to France and, like goods not in demand here, may
have found a market with you there. I have heard much talk
of the enlightenment that can be gained from books that are
sent from England. What improvements they underwent en
route (as it is said some liquors are improved by crossing
the sea) I cannot tell; but I never heard a man of common
judgment or the least degree of information speak a word in
praise of the greater part of the publications circulated by
that society; and no-one (except some of its members) has
regarded its doings as of any serious consequence.

Your National Assembly seems to have much the same
opinion that I do of this poor ‘charitable’ club. As a nation,
you reserved the whole stock of your eloquent acknowledge-
ments for the Revolution Society, when in fairness their

fellows in the Constitutional Society were entitled to some
share. Since you have selected the Revolution Society as
the great object of your national thanks and praises, you
will excuse me for making its recent conduct the subject
of my observations. The National Assembly of France has
given importance to these gentlemen by adopting them; and
they return the favour by acting as a committee in England
for extending the principles of the National Assembly. So
now we must consider them as a kind of privileged persons,
as considerable members of the diplomatic body. This is
one among the revolutions that have given splendour to
obscurity, and distinction to invisible merit. I don’t recall
having heard of this club until very recently. I am quite sure
that it never occupied a moment of my thoughts or, I believe,
of the thoughts of anyone outside their own set.
I ﬁnd,
upon inquiry, that on the anniversary of the Revolution in
1688 a club of dissenters [see Glossary] (of I don’t know what
denomination) have long had the custom of hearing a sermon
in one of their churches and spending the rest of the day
cheerfully, as other clubs do, at the tavern. But I never heard
that any public measure or political system—let alone the
merits of the constitution of any foreign nation—had been
the subject of a formal proceeding at their festivals; until
to my astonishment I found them issuing a congratulatory
address that gave authoritative approval to the activities of
the National Assembly in France.

I see nothing to object to in the original principles and
conduct of the club, at least so far as they were declared. I
think it very probable that for some purpose new members
may have entered among them, and that some truly Chris-
tian politicians, who love to dispense beneﬁts but are careful
to conceal the hand that distributes the dole, may have made
them the instruments of their pious designs. [That is a joke.
Burke is suggesting that the Revolution Society has been taken over by

‘new members’; he doesn’t seriously think that their purposes are ‘pious’
or that their attitude to secrecy is ‘truly Christian‘.] Whatever I may
have reason to suspect concerning private goings-on, I shall
speak only of what is public.

I would be sorry if anyone thought that I am directly
or indirectly concerned in the Society’s proceedings.
In
my individual and private capacity I take my full share,
along with everyone else, in speculating on what did or
does happen on the public stage in any place ancient or
modern—in the republic of Rome or the republic of Paris.
But having no general apostolic mission, and being a citizen
of a particular state and subject in a considerable degree
to its public will, I think it would be at least improper and
irregular for me to correspond formally and publicly with the
actual government of a foreign nation, without the explicit
authority of the government under which I live.

I would be still more unwilling to enter into that cor-
respondence under an equivocal description of who was
writing, which could lead foreign readers to think that the
document to which I was subscribing was the act of persons
in some sort of corporate capacity acknowledged by the laws
of this kingdom and authorised to speak for some part of it.
Because of the ambiguity and uncertainty of unauthorised
general descriptions, and of the deceit that can be practised
under them, the House of Commons would reject the most
sneaking petition for the most trivial object if it came with the
mode of signature ·that the Revolution Society has used in its
address to your National Assembly·. You have been deceived
by it into throwing open the folding doors of your presence
chamber ushering ·the Society’s proclamation· into your
National Assembly with as much ceremony and parade, and
with as great a bustle of applause, as if you were being visited
by the whole representative majesty of the whole English
nation! If what this Society has seen ﬁt to send you had

been a piece of argument, it wouldn’t have mattered much
whose argument it was; it would be neither more nor less
convincing because of the party it came from. But this is only
a vote and resolution. It stands solely on authority; and in
this case it is the mere authority of individuals, few of whom
appear. Their signatures ought to have been annexed to what
they wrote. The world would then know how many they are;
who they are; and what value their opinions may have given
their personal abilities, their knowledge, their experience, or
their lead and authority in this state. To a plain man like me
the proceeding looks a little too reﬁned and too ingenious;
it has too much the air of a political trick adopted for the
sake of giving, under a high-sounding name, an importance
to the public declarations of this club—declarations which,
when they came to be closely inspected, they didn’t entirely
deserve. It is a policy that has very much the complexion of
a fraud.

I ﬂatter myself that I love a manly, moral, regulated liberty
as well as any member of that Society; and the whole course
of my public conduct has perhaps given as good proofs of
my attachment to that cause ·as any of them could boast·. I
grudge liberty as little as they do to any other nation. But
I can’t stand up and praise or blame anything relating to
human actions and human concerns, on a simple view of
the object, as it stands stripped of every relation, in all the
nakedness and solitude of metaphysical abstraction. Some
gentlemen count circumstances as nothing, but in fact they
are what give to every political principle its distinguishing
colour and discriminating effect. The circumstances are what
make every civil and political scheme beneﬁcial or harmful
to mankind. Abstractly speaking, government is good and so
is liberty; but ten years ago could I in common sense have
congratulated France on her enjoyment of a government (for
she then had a government) without considering what the

3

Reﬂections on the Revolution in France

Edmund Burke

Part 1

nature of that government was or how it was administered?
Can I now congratulate the same nation on its freedom? Is
it because liberty in the abstract is one of the blessings of
mankind that I am seriously to congratulate a madman, who
has escaped from the protecting restraint and wholesome
darkness of his cell, on his restoration to the enjoyment
of light and liberty? If a murderous highwayman escapes
from prison, am I to congratulate him on the recovery of his
natural rights?. . . .

When I see the spirit of liberty in action, I see a strong
principle [see Glossary] at work; and for a while this is all I
can possibly know of it. The wild gas has clearly broken
loose; but we ought to suspend our judgment until the ﬁrst
effervescence has subsided a little, till the liquor is cleared
and we see something deeper than the agitation of a troubled
and frothy surface. Before I venture publicly to congratulate
men on a blessing, I must be tolerably sure that they have
really received one. Flattery corrupts both the receiver and
the giver, and adulation does no more good to the people
than to kings. So I should suspend my congratulations on
the new liberty of France until I was informed about how it
had been combined with

•government,
•public force,
•the discipline and obedience of armies,
•the collection of an effective and well-distributed
revenue,
•morality and religion,
•the solidity of property,
•peace and order,
•civil and social manners.

All these are good things too, in their way, and without them
liberty isn’t likely to last long and isn’t a beneﬁt while it
does. The effect of liberty on individuals is that they may do

what they please; we ought to see what it will please them
to do before we risk congratulations that may soon become
complaints. Prudence would dictate this ·even· in the case
of private men considered individually; but when men act
in bodies, liberty is power. Thinking people won’t declare
themselves ·on this· until they see the use that is made of
power, and particularly the use of such a testing thing as new
power in new persons of whose principles, temperaments
and dispositions they have little or no experience, and in
situations where those who appear the most active in the
scene may not be the real movers.

All these considerations, however, were below the high-
minded dignity of the Revolution Society. When I wrote to
you I was still in the country, and had only an imperfect
idea of their transactions. On returning to town I sent for
an account of their proceedings, which had been published
by their authority, containing a sermon of Dr Price, with the
letter of Duke de Rochefoucault and the Archbishop of Aix,
and several other documents annexed. The whole of that
publication, obviously aiming to connect the affairs of France
with those of England by drawing us into an imitation of the
conduct of the National Assembly, gave me a considerable
degree of uneasiness. The effect of that conduct on the power,
credit, prosperity, and tranquility of France became every
day more evident. The form of constitution to be settled
for its future polity became more clear. We are now in a
position to discern with tolerable [see Glossary] exactness, the
true nature of the object we are being invited to imitate.
If the prudence of reserve and decorum dictates silence in
some circumstances, in others prudence of a higher order
may justify us in speaking our thoughts. The beginnings of
confusion with us in England are at present feeble enough,
but with you ·in France· we have seen an even more feeble
infancy growing rapidly into a strength to heap mountains

on mountains and to wage war with heaven itself. When our
neighbour’s house is on ﬁre it can’t be wrong to have the
ﬁre-engines to play a little on our own. Better to be despised
for undue anxiety than ruined by undue conﬁdence.

Price’s sermon

Solicitous chieﬂy for the peace of my own country, but by
no means unconcerned for yours, I want to communicate at
more length and in more detail what was at ﬁrst intended
only for your private satisfaction. I shall still keep your affairs
in my eye and continue to address myself to you. Indulging
myself in the freedom that letter-writing gives me, I shall
throw out my thoughts and express my feelings just as they
arise in my mind, with little attention to formal method. I
start with the proceedings of the Revolution Society, but I
shan’t conﬁne myself to them. How could I? It appears to
me as if I were in a great crisis, of the affairs not of France
alone but of all Europe, perhaps of more than Europe. All
circumstances taken together, the French revolution is the
most astonishing one that has ever happened. The most
amazing things are brought about, many of them by the
most absurd and ridiculous means, in the most ridiculous
ways, and apparently by the most contemptible instruments.
Everything seems out of nature in this strange chaos of
levity [see Glossary] and ferocity, where all sorts of crimes are
jumbled together with all sorts of follies.
In viewing this
monstrous tragicomic scene, the most opposite passions
succeed other in the mind—alternate contempt and indig-
nation, alternate laughter and tears, alternate scorn and
horror—and sometimes the opposites mix together.

But it can’t be denied that to some people this strange
scene appeared quite different from that. In them it inspired
only sentiments of rejoicing and rapture. They saw in what

has happened in France nothing but a ﬁrm and temperate
exercise of freedom, so consistent on the whole with •morals
and with •piety as to deserve not only •the secular applause
of dashing Machiavellian politicians but also •the devout
effusions of sacred eloquence.

In the morning of last 4 November Dr Richard Price, an
eminent non-conforming minister, preached to his club or
society at the dissenting meeting house in the Old Jewry
[see Glossary] an extraordinary miscellaneous sermon.
It
includes some good moral and religious sentiments, not
badly expressed, mixed up in a sort of porridge of various
political opinions and reﬂections; but the main ingredient in
the cauldron is the Revolution in France. I regard the address
transmitted by the Revolution Society through Earl Stanhope
to the National Assembly as originating in the principles
of this sermon and as a corollary of them. The address
was moved by Dr Price. It was passed by those who came
steaming from the effect of the sermon, and they passed it
without any censure or qualiﬁcation, expressed or implied. If
any of the gentlemen concerned want to separate the sermon
from the resolution, they know how to acknowledge one and
disavow the other. They can do it; I cannot.

For my part, I saw that sermon as the public declara-
tion of a man much connected with literary conspirators
and intriguing philosophers, with political theologians and
theological politicians both at home and abroad.
I know
they set him up as a sort of oracle because he, with the
best intentions in the world, naturally orates and chants his
prophetic song in exact unison with their designs.

That sermon has a tone that I don’t think has been heard
in this kingdom, in any of the pulpits that are tolerated or
encouraged in it, since 1648 when the Rev. Hugh Peters
made the vault of the king’s own chapel at St. James’s ring
with the honour and privilege of the saints who, with the

5

Reﬂections on the Revolution in France

Edmund Burke

Part 1

‘high praises of God in their mouths, and a two-edged
sword in their hands, were to execute judgment on
the heathen, and punishments on the people; to bind
their kings with chains, and their nobles with fetters
of iron’.

Few harangues from the pulpit, except in the days of your
league in France or in the days of our Solemn League and
Covenant in England, have ever breathed less of the spirit
of moderation than Dr Price’s lecture in the Old Jewry. And
even if something like moderation were visible in this political
sermon, still politics and the pulpit are terms that have little
agreement. No sound ought to be heard in the church but the
healing voice of Christian charity. The cause of civil liberty
and civil government gains as little by this confusion of
duties as does the cause of religion. Most of those who leave
their proper character and take on what doesn’t belong to
them are ignorant both of the character they leave and of the
character they take on. Wholly unacquainted with the world
in which they are so fond of meddling, and inexperienced
in all its affairs that they pronounce on so conﬁdently, they
have nothing of politics but the passions they arouse. Surely
the church is a place where mankind’s dissensions and
animosities ought to be allowed one day’s truce.

This pulpit style, revived after so long a discontinuance,
had to me the air of novelty—a somewhat dangerous novelty.
I don’t ﬁnd every part of the discourse to be equally danger-
ous. The hint given to •a noble and reverend lay divine who
is supposed to hold high ofﬁce in one of our universities,
and to •other lay divines ‘of rank and literature’, may be
proper and seasonable, though somewhat new. Dr Price
advises these noble Seekers, if they ﬁnd nothing to satisfy
their pious fancies in the old staple of the national church,
or in all the rich variety to be found in the well-stocked
warehouses of the dissenting congregations, each to set up

a separate-meeting house on his own particular principles.
It is somewhat remarkable that this reverend divine should
be so earnest for setting up new churches and so perfectly
indifferent concerning the doctrine that may be taught in
them! His zeal is of a curious character. It is not for the
propagation of his own opinions but just of opinions. He is
zealous not for the diffusion of truth but for the spreading
of contradiction. As long as the noble teachers dissent, it
doesn’t matter from whom or from what they dissent. This
great point once secured, it is taken for granted their religion
will be rational and manly [see Glossary].
I doubt whether
religion would reap all the beneﬁts that the calculating
divine computes from this ‘great company of great preachers’.
It would certainly be a valuable addition of unclassiﬁed
specimens to the ample collection of known genera and
species that at present beautify the display-cases of dissent.
A sermon from a noble duke, or a noble marquis, or a noble
earl, or baron bold would certainly increase and diversify
the amusements of this town that is starting to be bored. I
would only stipulate that these new Mess-Johns [see Glossary]
in robes and coronets should keep some sort of bounds in
the democratic and leveling principles that are expected from
their titled pulpits. I expect that the new evangelists will
disappoint the hopes that are conceived of them. . . .

But I may say of our preacher ‘If only he’d devoted the
whole of those savage times to frivolities’ [Burke gives this in
Latin, quoted from the Latin poet Juvenal]. Not everything in this
thunderous bull [see Glossary] of his are so harmless. His
doctrines affect our constitution in its vital parts. He tells the
Revolution Society in this political sermon that his Majesty
‘is almost the only lawful king in the world because the
only one who owes his crown to the choice of his people’.
As to the kings of the world, all of whom (except one) this
archpontiff of the rights of men, with all the plenitude and

6

with more than the boldness of the papal deposing power in
its 12th century fervour, puts into one sweeping clause of
ban and anathema and proclaims to be usurpers:. . . . they
had better consider how they admit into their territories
these apostolic missionaries who will tell their subjects that
they aren’t lawful kings. That is their concern. Our concern,
as an important domestic matter, is to consider seriously
the solidity of the only principle on which these gentlemen
acknowledge a king of Great Britain to be entitled to their
allegiance.

This doctrine, as applied to the prince [see Glossary] now on
the British throne, either •is nonsense and therefore neither
true nor false, or •afﬁrms a most unfounded, dangerous,
illegal, and unconstitutional position. According to this
spiritual doctor of politics, if his Majesty does not owe his
crown to the choice of his people, he is no lawful king.
Now nothing can be more untrue than that the crown of
this kingdom is so held by his Majesty. So if you follow
their rule, the king of Great Britain, who certainly does
not owe his high ofﬁce to any form of popular [see Glossary]
election, is no better than the rest of the gang of usurpers
who reign (or rather rob) all over the face of our miserable
world with no right or title to the allegiance of their people.
The policy of this general doctrine, thus understood, is
evident enough. The propagators of this political gospel
hope that their abstract principle—that a popular choice is
necessary for the legal existence of the sovereign rule—would
be overlooked as long as the king of Great Britain was not
affected by it. In the meantime the ears of their congregations
would gradually get used to it, as if it were a ﬁrst principle
admitted without dispute. In the meantime it would operate
only as a theory, pickled in the preserving juices of pulpit
eloquence and stored for future use. . . . By this policy, while
our government is soothed with a reservation in its favour to

which it has no claim, the security it has in common with all
governments—so far as opinion is security—is taken away.
Thus these politicians go ahead while little notice is taken
of their doctrines; but when they come to be examined on
the plain meaning of their words and the direct tendency of
their doctrines, then ambiguities and slippery constructions
come into play. When they say the king owes his crown
to the choice of his people and is therefore the only lawful
sovereign in the world, perhaps they’ll tell us that they mean
only that some of the king’s predecessors have been called
to the throne by some sort of choice, and therefore he owes
his crown to the choice of his people. Thus, by a miserable
subterfuge, they hope to make their proposition safe by
making it vacuous. They are welcome to the asylum they
seek for their offence, since they are taking refuge in their
folly. For if you admit this interpretation, how does their
idea of election differ from our idea of inheritance?

And how does the settlement of the crown in the
Brunswick line derived from James I come to legalise •our
monarchy rather than •that of any of the neighbouring
countries? At some time or other, to be sure, all the
beginners of dynasties were chosen by those who called
them to govern. There is ground enough for the opinion that
all the kingdoms of Europe were, a long time ago, elective,
with some limitations on the objects of choice. But whatever
kings might have been here or elsewhere a thousand years
ago, or in whatever manner the ruling dynasties of England
or France may have begun, the king of Great Britain is today
king by a ﬁxed rule of succession according to the laws of
his country; and for as long as the legal conditions of the
compact of sovereignty are performed by him (as they are),
he holds his crown regardless of the choice of the Revolution
Society, who don’t have a single vote for a king among them,
either individually or collectively (though I’m sure they would

7

Part 1

soon erect themselves into an electoral college if things were
ripe to give effect to their claim). His Majesty’s heirs and
successors, each in his time and order, will come to the
crown in a manner to which their choice is equally irrelevant.

Whatever success of evasion they may have in explaining
away the gross error of fact which supposes that his Majesty
owes his crown to the choice of his people, nothing can evade
their full explicit declaration concerning the principle of the
people’s right to choose—a right that is directly maintained
and tenaciously adhered to. All the oblique insinuations
about election rest on this proposition. Lest the foundation
of the king’s exclusive legal title should pass for a mere rant
of adulatory freedom, the political divine [= Price] proceeds to
assert dogmatically that by the principles of the Revolution
the people of England have acquired three fundamental
rights, all of which (in his hands) compose one system and
lie together in one short sentence. It is that we have acquired
a right:

(1) to choose our own rulers,
(2) to dismiss them for misconduct, and
(3) to form a government for ourselves.

This previously unheard-of bill of rights, though made in the
name of the whole people, belongs to those gentlemen and
their faction only. The body of the people of England have
no share in it. They utterly disclaim it. They will resist the
practical assertion of it with their lives and fortunes. They
are bound to do so by the laws of their country made at the
time of that very Revolution ·of 1688· that is appealed to
in favour of the ﬁctitious rights claimed by the Society that
abuses its name.

The ﬁrst claimed right: to choose our own rulers

These gentlemen of the Old Jewry, in all their reasonings
on (2) the Revolution of 1688, have (1) a revolution that
happened in England about 40 years earlier and (3) the
recent French revolution, so much before their eyes and
in their hearts that they are constantly running the three
together. It is necessary that we separate them. We must
check their erring fancies against the acts of the Revolution
that we revere, for the discovery of its true principles. If the
principles of the Revolution of 1688 are anywhere to be found,
it is in the statute called the Declaration of Right. In that
most wise, sober, and considerate declaration—drawn up by
great lawyers and great statesmen, and not by hot-headed
and inexperienced zealots—not one word is said, nor one
suggestion made, of a general right ‘to choose our own rulers,
to dismiss them for misconduct, and to form a government
for ourselves’.

This Declaration of Right is the cornerstone of our con-
stitution as reinforced, explained, improved, and in its
fundamental principles for ever settled. It is called ‘An Act
for declaring the rights and liberties of the subject, and for
settling the succession of the crown’. You will observe that
these rights and this succession are declared in one body
and bound indissolubly together.

A few years after this period, a second opportunity came
up for asserting a right of election to the crown. With the
prospect of King William’s having no offspring, and the
Princess (afterwards Queen) Anne likewise, the legislature
had to consider again the settlement of the crown and further
security for the liberties of the people. Did they this second
time make any provision for legalising the crown on the
spurious revolution principles of the Old Jewry? No. They
followed the principles that prevailed in the Declaration

8

Reﬂections on the Revolution in France

Edmund Burke

Part 1

of Right, indicating with more precision the persons who
were to inherit ·the crown· in the Protestant line. Following
the same policy, they incorporated •our liberties and •an
hereditary succession in a single act. Instead of a ‘right to
choose our own governors’, they declared that the succession
in the Protestant line drawn from James I was absolutely
necessary ‘for the peace, quiet, and security of the realm’,
and that it was a matter of urgency ‘to maintain a certainty
in the succession thereof, to which the subjects may safely
have recourse for their protection’. Both these acts, in which
are heard the unerring and unambiguous oracles of revo-
lution policy, instead of countenancing the delusive gypsy
predictions of a ‘right to choose our governors’ rigorously
prove how totally the nation’s wisdom opposed turning a
case of necessity into a rule of law.

A small and temporary deviation

Unquestionably, there was at the Revolution, in the person
of King William, a small and a temporary deviation from
the strict order of a regular hereditary succession; but it
is against all genuine principles of jurisprudence to draw a
principle from a law made in a special case and regarding
an individual person. If ever there was a time favourable for
establishing •the principle that a king of popular choice was
the only legal king, without doubt it was at the Revolution.
Its not being done then proves that the nation thought
it ought not to be done at any time. Anyone who isn’t
completely ignorant of our history knows that the majority
in parliament of both parties were so little inclined to accept
anything resembling •that principle that at ﬁrst they resolved
to place the vacant crown not on the head of the Prince
of Orange but on that of his wife Mary—daughter of King
James, and the eldest born of the offspring of that king

which they acknowledged to be undoubtedly his. It would
be repeating a very trite story to recall to your memory all
the circumstances showing that their acceptance of King
William was not properly a •choice but— to all those who
didn’t want to recall King James or to deluge their country
in blood and again to bring their religion, laws, and liberties
into the peril they had just escaped—it was in the strictest
sense a •necessity.

In this episode parliament departed—for a time, and in a
single case—from the strict order of inheritance in favour of a
prince who, though not next in line, was very near in the line
of succession [Charles I of England was his maternal grandfather]. It
is curious to observe how Lord Somers, who wrote the bill
called the Declaration of Right, comported himself on that
delicate occasion. It is curious to observe how skillfully this
temporary departure from the strict order is kept from the
eye, while all that could be found in this act of necessity
to support the idea of an hereditary succession is brought
forward, developed, and made the most of by this great man
and by the legislature who followed him. Leaving the dry,
imperative style of an act of parliament, he makes the Lords
and Commons engage in a pious legislative exclamation,
declaring that they consider it ‘as a marvellous providence
and merciful goodness of God to this nation to preserve
their said Majesties’ royal persons most happily to reign over
us on the throne of their ancestors, for which, from the
bottom of their hearts, they return their humblest thanks
and praises’. . . .

In the act of King William, the Lords and Commons didn’t
thank God that they had found a fair opportunity to assert
a right to choose their own governors, much less to make
an election the only lawful title to the crown. Their having
been in a position to avoid the very appearance of it, as
much as possible, was considered by them as a providential

9

Reﬂections on the Revolution in France

Edmund Burke

Part 1

escape! They threw a politic, well-woven veil over every detail
tending to weaken the rights that they meant to perpetuate
in the improved order of succession, or that might furnish a
precedent for any future departure from what they had then
settled forever. . . .

[He goes on at some length about the strength of the lan-
guage in which parliament highlighted the idea of hereditary
succession, and about the sources of that language in ‘the
declaratory statutes of Queen Mary and Queen Elizabeth’.]
They knew that a doubtful title of succession would too
much resemble an election, and that an election would
utterly destroy the ‘unity, peace, and tranquillity of this
nation’, which they thought to be considerations of some
importance. To provide for these objectives—and therefore to
exclude for ever the Old Jewry doctrine of a ‘right to choose
our own governors’—they follow with a clause containing a
solemn pledge taken from the earlier act of Queen Elizabeth,
as solemn a pledge as ever could be given in favour of
an hereditary succession, and as solemn a renunciation
as could be made of the principles attributed to them by
this ·Revolution· Society: ‘The Lords spiritual and temporal,
and Commons, do in the name of all the people aforesaid
most humbly and faithfully submit themselves, their heirs
and posterities for ever; and do faithfully promise that they
will maintain and defend their said Majesties, and also the
limitation of the crown herein speciﬁed and contained, to the
utmost of their powers’ etc.

So far is it from being true that we acquired a right by
the Revolution to elect our kings that, if we had possessed it
before, the English nation did at that time solemnly renounce
it for themselves and for all their posterity forever.

These gentlemen may value themselves as much as they
please on their whig principles, but I never desire to be
thought a better whig than Lord Somers, or to understand

the principles of the Revolution better than those who
brought it about, or to read in the Declaration of Right
any mysteries unknown to those who wrote it—those whose
penetrating style has engraved in our ordinances and in our
hearts the words and spirit of that immortal law.

It is true that the nation, aided by the powers derived
from force and opportunity, was at that time in a sense free
to take what course it pleased for ﬁlling the throne, but only
free to do so on the same grounds on which they might have
wholly abolished their monarchy and every other part of
their constitution. But they didn’t think they were entitled
to make such bold changes. It is indeed difﬁcult, perhaps
impossible, to state in abstract terms what the limits were to
the supreme power exercised by parliament at that time; but
the limits of a moral competence making (even in
powers more indisputably sovereign) occasional will
subordinate to permanent reason and to the steady
maxims of faith, justice, and ﬁxed fundamental policy
are perfectly intelligible and perfectly binding upon those
who exercise any authority, under any name or under any
title, in the state. The House of Lords, for instance, is not
morally competent to dissolve the House of Commons, nor
even to dissolve itself or to abdicate its part in the legislature
of the kingdom. A king may abdicate for his own person, but
he can’t abdicate for the monarchy. And for at least as strong
a reason the House of Commons can’t renounce its share
of authority. The engagement and pact of society, generally
called ‘the constitution’, forbids such invasion and such
surrender. The constituent parts of a state are obliged to
keep faith with each other and with all those whose interests
are seriously affected by their activities, just as the whole
state is bound to keep its faith with separate communities.
Otherwise competence would soon be confused with power,
and no law would remain but the will of a prevailing force.

10

Part 1

On this principle the succession of the crown has always
been what it now is, an hereditary succession by law; in the
old line it was a succession by the common law; in the new,
by the statute law operating on the principles of the common
law—not changing the substance but regulating the method
and describing the persons. Both these kinds of law have the
same force and are derived from an equal authority emanat-
ing from the common agreement and original compact of the
state, by the collective contract of the commonwealth [Burke
gives this phrase in Latin], and as such they are equally binding
on king and people as long as the terms are observed and
they continue the same body politic.

If we don’t allow ourselves to be entangled in the mazes
of metaphysical sophistry [see Glossary] it is perfectly possible
to reconcile •the use of a ﬁxed rule with •an occasional devi-
ation, reconciling •the sacredness of an hereditary principle
of succession in our government with •a power to change
its application in cases of extreme emergency. Even in that
extremity (if we take the measure of our rights by our exercise
of them at the Revolution), the change is to be conﬁned to the
part ·of the government· that made the deviation necessary;
and even then it is to be done without decomposing the whole
civil and political mass so as to originate a new civil order
out of the basic raw materials of society.

A state with no means to make changes has no means to
preserve itself. Without such means a state might even risk
the loss of the part of its constitution that it most devoutly
wished to preserve. The two principles of •conservation
and •correction operated strongly at the two critical periods
of the Restoration ·of the monarchy after the collapse of
Cromwell’s regime· and the Revolution, at each of which
England found itself without a king. At both those periods
the nation had lost the bond of union in their ancient ediﬁce,
but they didn’t reduce the whole structure to rubble. On

the contrary, in both cases they regenerated the deﬁcient
part of the old constitution through the parts that were not
damaged. They kept these old parts exactly as they were, so
as to make the recovered part ﬁt with them. . . . The sovereign
legislature may never have shown a more tender regard for
that fundamental principle of British constitutional policy
than when, at the time of the Revolution, it deviated from the
direct line of hereditary succession. The crown was carried
somewhat out of the line in which it had before moved, but
the new line was derived from the same stock. It was still a
line of hereditary descent, still an hereditary descent in the
same blood, though now qualiﬁed with Protestantism. When
the legislature altered the direction but kept the principle,
they showed that they held the principle to be inviolable.

On this principle, the law of inheritance had admitted
some amendment in earlier times long before the era of the
Revolution. Some time after the ·Norman· Conquest ·in
1066·, great questions arose about the legal principles of
hereditary descent. It became a matter of doubt whether a
deceased monarch’s crown should go to his oldest offspring
or the oldest member of his family, but through all this—and
the matter of the crown bypassing a Catholic so as to go to a
Protestant—the principle of inheritance survived with a sort
of immortality through all transmigrations. . . . This is the
spirit of our constitution, not only in its settled course but
in all its revolutions. Whoever came in and however he came
in, whether he obtained the crown by law or by force, the
hereditary succession was either continued or adopted.

The gentlemen of the Society for Revolution see nothing
in the revolution of 1688 but the deviation from the con-
stitution; and they take •the deviation from the principle
to be •the principle. They have little regard to the obvious
consequences of their doctrine, though they must see that
it leaves very few of the positive [see Glossary] institutions

of this country with any positive authority. If the unwar-
rantable maxim that no throne is lawful except the elective
is established, no one act of the princes [see Glossary] who
preceded this era of ﬁctitious election can be valid. Do these
theorists mean to imitate some of their predecessors who
dragged the bodies of our ancient sovereigns out of the quiet
of their tombs? Do they mean to accuse and retroactively
disempower all the kings who reigned before the Revolution,
and consequently to stain the throne of England with the
blot of a continual usurpation? Do they mean to invalidate,
annul, or call into question not only

•the titles of the whole line of our kings, but also
•the great body of our statute law that passed under
those whom they treat as usurpers?

This would be to annul laws of inestimable value to our
liberties—at least as valuable as any that have passed since
the time of the Revolution? If kings who didn’t owe their
crown to the choice of their people had no title to make laws,
what will become of

(i) the statute de tallagio non concedendo?
(ii) the petition of right?
(iii) the act of habeas corpus?

[(i) a 13th century law forbidding the king to raise taxes independently
of parliament; (ii) a constitutional document of 1626 setting other limits
to what the kind could do; (iii) a legal protection against secret imprison-
ment.] Do these new doctors of the rights of men presume to
assert that King James II, who came to the crown as next
of kin ·to the deceased Charles II·, according to the rules
of a then unqualiﬁed succession, was not to all intents and
purposes a lawful king of England before he had done any of
the acts that were rightly taken to amount to an abdication of
his crown? If he was not, much trouble in parliament might
have been saved at the period these gentlemen commemorate.
But King James was a bad king with a good title, and not

a usurper. The princes who succeeded, according to the
act of parliament that settled the crown on the Electress ·of
Hanover· Sophia and on her descendants, being Protestants,
came in as much by a title of inheritance as King James
did. He came in according to the law as it was at the time of
his accession to the crown; and the princes of the House of
Brunswick came to inherit the crown not by election but by
the law as it was at the times when they variously came to
the crown through Protestant descent and inheritance, as I
hope I have shown sufﬁciently.

The law by which this royal family is speciﬁcally destined
to the succession is the act of the 12th and 13th of King
William. The terms of this act bind ‘us and our heirs, and
our posterity, to them, their heirs, and their posterity’, being
Protestants, to the end of time, in the same words as the
Declaration of Right had bound us to the heirs of King
William and Queen Mary. It therefore secures both an hered-
itary crown and an hereditary allegiance. On what ground,
except the constitutional policy of forming an establishment
to secure that kind of succession—precluding a choice of
the people forever—could the legislature have fastidiously
rejected the abundant choice which our country presented
to them and searched in strange lands for a foreign princess
from whose womb the line of our future rulers were to derive
their title to govern millions of men through a series of ages?
The Princess Sophia was named in the act of settlement of
1701 as a stock and root of inheritance to our kings. She was
named not •for her merits as a temporary administratrix of a
power that she might not (and in fact did not) ever exercise,
but •for just one reason, stated in the act:

‘The most excellent Princess Sophia, Electress and
Duchess Dowager of Hanover, is daughter of the most
excellent Princess Elizabeth, late Queen of Bohemia,
daughter of our late sovereign lord King James I of

12

Reﬂections on the Revolution in France

Part 1

happy memory, and is hereby declared to be the next
in succession in the Protestant line etc., etc., and the
crown shall continue to the heirs of her body, being
Protestants.’

Parliament made this act so that through the Princess Sophia
not only was an inheritable line to be continued in future but
(what they thought very important) it was to be connected
with the old stock of inheritance in King James I, so that
the monarchy might preserve an unbroken unity through
all ages and might be preserved (with safety to our religion)
in the old approved mode by descent. . . . They did well. No
experience has taught us that our liberties can be regularly
perpetuated and kept sacred as our hereditary right except
through an hereditary crown .

An irregular, convulsive movement may be necessary to
throw off an irregular, convulsive disease. But the course of
succession is the healthy habit of the British constitution.
When the legislature passed the act for the limitation of the
crown in the Hanoverian line, drawn through the female
descendants of James I, did they lack a proper sense of the
drawbacks of having two or three or even more foreigners
in succession to the British throne? No! They had a
proper sense of the evils that might come from such foreign
rule—more than a proper sense of them. They continued to
adopt a plan of hereditary Protestant succession in the old
line, with all the dangers and drawbacks of its being a foreign
line fully before their eyes and operating with the utmost
force on their minds. There couldn’t be a more decisive proof
of the British nation’s full conviction that the principles of
the Revolution did not authorise them to elect kings at their
pleasure and without attention to the ancient fundamental
principles of our government.

A few years ago I would have been ashamed to support
with heavy argument a matter so capable of supporting itself;

but this seditious, unconstitutional doctrine is now publicly
taught, avowed, and printed.

•My dislike for revolutions, the signals for that have so
often been given from pulpits;
•the spirit of change that is spreading through the
world; and
•the total contempt that prevails with you, and may
come to prevail with us, for all ancient institutions
when they oppose a present sense of convenience or a
present inclination;

—all these considerations make it advisable, in my opinion,
to call our attention back to the true principles of our own
domestic laws, so that you, my French friend, should begin to
know them, and so that we should continue to cherish them.
We ought not on either side of the water to let ourselves to
be imposed on by the counterfeit wares that some persons,
by a double fraud, export to you in illicit barges as raw
commodities of British growth (though wholly alien to our
soil), in order then to smuggle them back again into this
country, manufactured into an ‘improved’ liberty after the
newest Paris fashion.

The people of England won’t ape the fashions they have
never tried, or return to ones they have tried and found to
be harmful. They look on the legal hereditary succession of
their crown as among their rights, not their wrongs; as a
beneﬁt, not a grievance; as a security for their liberty, not a
badge of servitude. . . .

Divine right of kings

Before I go any further, let me take notice of some cheap
tricks that the abettors of election, as the only lawful title
to the crown, are ready to use so as to make the support
of the just principles of our constitution a dislikable task.

13

Reﬂections on the Revolution in France

Edmund Burke

Part 1

When you defend the inheritable nature of the crown, these
tricksters present you as supporting a ﬁctitious cause and
ﬁctional people. They commonly argue as if they were in
a conﬂict with some of those exploded fanatics of slavery
who used to maintain what I believe no-one now maintains,
namely ‘that the crown is held by divine hereditary and
indefeasible right’. These old fanatics of single arbitrary
power dogmatised as if hereditary royalty was the only lawful
government in the world, just as our new fanatics of popular
arbitrary power maintain that a popular election is the sole
lawful source of authority. The old prerogative extremists
did indeed speculate foolishly, and perhaps impiously too,
implying •that monarchy has more of a divine sanction than
any other mode of government, and •that a right to govern
by inheritance is something that no civil or political right can
be, namely strictly indefeasible in all circumstances for any
person who is in the line of succession to a throne. But an
absurd opinion concerning the king’s hereditary right to the
crown doesn’t prejudice one that is rational and based on
solid principles of law and policy. If all the absurd theories
of lawyers and divines were to destroy the things they are
talking about we would have no law and no religion left in the
world! An absurd theory on one side of a question doesn’t
justify telling untruths or promulgating mischievous maxims
on the other.

The second claimed right:
misconduct

to dismiss kings for

Of the three claims of the Revolution Society listed on
page 8, the second is ‘a right of dismissing their governors
for misconduct’. If the declaration of the act implying the
abdication of James II had any fault, it’s that it was rather
too guarded and too circumstantial [here = ‘clotted with detail’];

and this may have been because those ancestors of ours were
anxious not to form such a precedent as that of ‘dismissing
for misconduct’. But all this guardedness and all this
accumulation of circumstances serves to show the spirit
of caution that predominated in the national councils in a
situation where men irritated by oppression and elevated
by a triumph over it might have abandoned themselves to
violent and extreme courses of action; it shows, regarding
the great men who inﬂuenced the conduct of affairs at that
great event, how anxious they were to make the Revolution a
parent of settlement and not a nursery of future revolutions.
No government could stand for a moment if it could be
blown down by anything as loose and indeﬁnite as an opinion
of ‘misconduct’. Those who led at the Revolution based
the virtual abdication of King James on no such light and
uncertain principle. They charged him with nothing less than
a design, conﬁrmed by many open illegal acts, to subvert
the Protestant church and state and their fundamental,
unquestionable laws and liberties; they charged him with
having broken the original contract between king and people.
This was more than ‘misconduct’. A grave and overruling
necessity obliged them to take the step they took, and took
with inﬁnite reluctance, under that most rigorous of all
laws [presumably referring to the original contract between king and
people]. They didn’t rely on future revolutions for the future
preservation of the constitution; the grand policy of all their
regulations was to make it almost impracticable for any
future sovereign to compel the states [see Glossary] of the
kingdom to have recourse again to those violent remedies.
They left the crown in the condition of being perfectly ir-
responsible [= ‘completely exempt from legal responsibility’], which
is what it had always been in the eye and estimation of
law. In order to lighten the crown still further, they added
responsibility to ministers of state. •By the statute called

14

Reﬂections on the Revolution in France

Edmund Burke

Part 1

‘the act for declaring the rights and liberties of the subject,
and for settling the succession of the crown’, they enacted
that the ministers should serve the crown on the terms of
that declaration. •Then they secured frequent meetings of
parliament by which the whole government would be under
the constant inspection and active control of the popular
representative and of the magnates of the kingdom.
•In
their next great constitutional act. . . .for further limiting
the crown and better securing the rights and liberties of
the subject, they provided ‘that no pardon under the great
seal of England should be pleadable to an impeachment
by the Commons in parliament’. These three—•the rule
laid down for government in the Declaration of Right, •the
constant inspection of parliament, and •the practical claim
of impeachment—they thought to provide an inﬁnitely better
security for their constitutional liberty and against the vices
of administration than could be provided by their claiming
a right so difﬁcult in the practice, so uncertain in outcome,
and often so mischievous in the consequences, as that of
‘dismissing their governors’.

Kings as servants of the people

Dr Price in this sermon very properly condemns the practice
of gross, adulatory addresses to kings.
Instead of this
fulsome style he proposes that on occasions of congratulation
his Majesty should be told that ‘he is to consider himself as
more properly the servant than the sovereign of his people’.
As a compliment, this new form of address doesn’t seem to
be very soothing! Those who are servants in name as well
as in effect don’t like to be told of their situation, their duty,
and their obligations. . . . It is not pleasant as compliment;
it is not wholesome as instruction. After all, if the king
were to adopt this language and take the label ‘Servant of

the People’ as his royal style, I can’t imagine what good
this would do us, or him.
I have seen very proud letters
signed ‘Your most obedient, humble servant’. The proudest
denomination that ever was endured on earth—·the Roman
Catholic Church·—took a title of still greater humility than
the one now proposed for sovereigns by the Apostle of Liberty
[Price]. Kings and nations were trodden down by the foot of
one calling himself ‘the Servant of Servants’; and mandates
for deposing sovereigns were sealed with the signet of ‘the
Fisherman’.

I would have considered all this ·‘servant’ stuff· as merely
a sort of ﬂippant empty discourse in which some people allow
the spirit of liberty to evaporate, if it weren’t plainly offered
in support of the idea of ‘dismissing kings for misconduct’.
In that light it is worth some discussion.

Kings are undoubtedly the servants of the people in one
sense, because their power has no rational purpose except
the general advantage; but (by our constitution, at least) it
isn’t true that they are anything like servants in the ordinary
sense of the word. The essence of a servant’s situation is to
obey the commands of someone else and to be removable at
pleasure. But the king of Great Britain obeys no-one else;
all other persons are—individually and collectively—under
him and owe him a legal obedience. The law, which doesn’t
know how to ﬂatter or to insult, calls this high magistrate
not our servant, as this humble divine [Price] calls him, but
‘our sovereign Lord the king’; and we have only learned to
speak the primitive language of the law, and not the confused
jargon of their Babylonian pulpits.

Because he is not to obey us and we are to obey the
law in him, our constitution doesn’t in any way make him,
as a servant, in any degree responsible. Our constitution
knows nothing of a magistrate like the Justicia of Aragon,
or of any legally appointed court or legally settled process

15

Edmund Burke

Part 1

for submitting the king to the responsibility belonging to all
servants. In this he is not distinguished from the Commons
and the Lords, who in their various public capacities can
never be called to account for their conduct. Yet the Revo-
lution Society chooses to assert, in direct opposition to one
of the wisest and most beautiful parts of our constitution,
that ‘a king is no more than the ﬁrst servant of the public,
created by it, and responsible to it’.

Our ancestors at the Revolution wouldn’t have deserved
their fame for wisdom if they had found no security for
their freedom except making their government feeble in its
operations and precarious in its tenure; if they couldn’t
devise any better remedy against arbitrary power than civil
confusion. Let these gentlemen state who the representative
public is to whom they will afﬁrm that the king as a servant
is to be responsible. It will then be time enough for me to
show them the positive statute law that afﬁrms that he is
not.

The ceremony of dismissing kings, which these gentlemen
casually talk about so much, can seldom if ever be performed
without force.
It then becomes a case of war, and not of
constitution. Laws are commanded to hold their tongues
among arms, and tribunals fall to the ground with the
peace they are no longer able to uphold. The Revolution
of 1688 was obtained by a just war, in the only case in
which any war, and much more a civil war, can be just.
‘Wars are just to those for whom they are necessary’ [Burke
says this in Latin, misquoting Livy]. The question of dethroning
or ‘dismissing’ kings always was and always will be an
extraordinary question of state, and wholly out of the law—a
question (like all other questions of state) of dispositions and
means and probable consequences rather than of positive
rights. Not having been made for common abuses, it isn’t to
be thought about by common minds. The theoretical line of

demarcation where obedience ought to end and resistance
must begin is faint, obscure, and not easily deﬁnable. It isn’t
determined by any single act or single event. Governments
must be abused and deranged indeed before dismissal can
be thought of; and the prospect of the future ·if there is
no dismissal· must be as bad as the experience of the past.
When things are as bad as that, the nature of the disease
will have to indicate the remedy to those whom nature has
qualiﬁed to administer in extremities this crucial, ambiguous,
bitter medicine to a sick state. Times and occasions and
provocations will teach their own lessons. The wise will
determine from the gravity of the case; the irritable from
awareness of oppression; the high-minded from disdain and
indignation at abusive power in unworthy hands; the brave
and bold from the love of honourable danger in a generous
cause; but, with or without right, a revolution will be the
very last resource of the thinking and the good.

The third claimed right: to form a government for
ourselves

The third of the three rights claimed from the pulpit of the Old
Jewry and listed on page 8 is the ‘right to form a government
for ourselves’. This gets as little support—whether through
precedent or principle—from anything done at the Revolution
as each of their ﬁrst two claims. The Revolution was made
to preserve our ancient, indisputable laws and liberties and
that ancient constitution of government which is our only
security for law and liberty. If you want to know •the spirit
of our constitution and •the policy that predominated in that
great period that has secured it to this hour, please look for
both in our histories, our records, our acts of parliament, and
journals of parliament—and not in the sermons of the Old
Jewry and the after-dinner toasts of the Revolution Society!

16

Reﬂections on the Revolution in France

Edmund Burke

Part 1

In the former you will ﬁnd other ideas and another language.
The third rights-claim is as ill-suited to our temperament and
wishes as it is unsupported by any appearance of authority.
The very idea of the making of a new government is enough to
ﬁll us with disgust and horror. At the time of the Revolution
we wanted, as we still do, to derive all we possess as an
inheritance from our forefathers. We have taken care not
to graft onto that body and stock of inheritance any shoot
that is alien to the nature of the original plant. All the
reformations we have proceeded on the principle of reverence
for antiquity; and I hope—indeed, I am convinced—that any
future reformations will be carefully formed on analogical
precedent, authority, and example.

Our liberties as an inheritance

Our oldest reformation is that of Magna Charta. You will
see that Sir Edward Coke, that great oracle of our law and
indeed all the great men who follow him. . . .work hard to
prove the pedigree of our liberties. They try to prove that
the Magna Charta of King John was connected with another
positive [see Glossary] charter from Henry I, and that both of
these were nothing more than a reafﬁrmation of the still
more ancient standing law of the kingdom. On the matter of
fact these authors appear to be mostly in the right though
perhaps not always; but if the lawyers go wrong in some
details that proves my position still more strongly, because
it demonstrates the powerful tendency to favour antiquity
that has always ﬁlled the minds of all our lawyers and
legislators and of all the people they want to inﬂuence, and
the unchanging policy of this kingdom in considering their
most sacred rights and franchises as an inheritance.

In the famous law of Charles I’s time called the Petition
of Right, the parliament says to the king ‘Your subjects

have inherited this freedom’, claiming their freedoms not
on abstract principles as ‘the rights of men’, but as the
rights of Englishmen inherited from their forefathers. Selden
and the other profoundly learned men who drew up this
Petition of Right were at least as well acquainted with all the
general theories concerning the ‘rights of men’ as any of the
discoursers in our pulpits or on your tribune ·in Paris·—as
well as Dr Price or the Abbé Sieyès. But, for reasons worthy
of the practical wisdom that superseded their theoretical
science, they preferred •this positive, recorded, hereditary
title to everything that can be dear to the man and the
citizen to •the vague theoretical right that exposed their
secure inheritance to being scrambled for and torn to pieces
by every wild and litigious spirit.

The same policy pervades all the laws that have since
been made for the preservation of our liberties. In in the
famous statute called the Declaration of Right, of the time of
William and Mary, the two houses of parliament don’t utter
a syllable of ‘a right to form a government for themselves’.
You will see that their whole care was to secure the religion,
laws, and liberties that had been long possessed and recently
endangered. ‘Taking into their most serious consideration
the best means for making an establishment that will not
again put their religion, laws, and liberties in danger of being
subverted’, they ceremonially initiate all their proceedings by
stating as some of those best means ‘in the ﬁrst place’ to do
‘as their ancestors in like cases have usually done for vindi-
cating their ancient rights and liberties, to declare. . . ’—and
then they pray the king and queen ‘that it may be declared
and enacted that all the rights and liberties asserted and
declared are the true ancient and indubitable rights and
liberties of the people of this kingdom’.

You will observe that from Magna Charta to the Dec-
laration of Right it has been the uniform policy of our

17

Reﬂections on the Revolution in France

Edmund Burke

Part 1

constitution to claim and assert our liberties as an entailed
[see Glossary] inheritance that we have from our forefathers
and are to transmit to our posterity—as an estate specially
belonging to the people of this kingdom, with no reference
to any other more general or prior right. By this means our
constitution preserves its unity in the great diversity of its
parts. We have an inheritable crown, an inheritable peerage,
and a House of Commons and a people inheriting privileges,
franchises, and liberties from a long line of ancestors.

This policy appears to me to be the result of profound
reﬂection, or rather the happy effect of following nature,
which is wisdom without reﬂection and above reﬂection.
A spirit of innovation is generally the result of a selﬁsh
temperament and limited views. People who never look back
to their ancestors will not look forward to posterity. Besides,
the people of England know well that the idea of inheritance
provides a sure principle of •conservation and a sure princi-
ple of •transmission, without at all excluding a principle of
•improvement. . . . Whatever advantages are obtained by a
state proceeding on these maxims are locked fast as in a sort
of family settlement, held tight for ever. By a constitutional
policy that follows the pattern of nature, we receive, hold,
and transmit (i) our government and our privileges in the
same way as we enjoy and transmit (ii) our property and
(iii) our lives. The (i) institutions of policy, the (ii) goods of
fortune, and (iii) the gifts of providence are handed down
to us, and from us, in the same course and order. Our
political system is placed in a sound correspondence and
symmetry with the order of the world and with the kind
of existence possessed by a permanent body composed of
transitory parts. ·God’s· stupendous wisdom molds together
the great mysterious body of the human race is such a way
that the whole thing is never at one time old or middle-aged
or young, but moves on—unchangeably constant—through

the varied tenor of perpetual decay, fall, renovation, and
progression. Thus, by preserving the method of nature
in the conduct of the state: •in what we improve we are
never wholly new; •in what we retain we are never wholly
obsolete. By adhering to our forefathers in this way and
on those principles, we are guided not by the superstition
of antiquarians but by the spirit of philosophical analogy.
In this choice of inheritance we have given to our political
structure the image of a blood-relationship, binding up
the constitution of our country with our dearest domestic
ties, adopting our fundamental laws into the bosom of our
family affections, keeping inseparable (and cherishing with
the warmth of all their combined and mutually reﬂected
charities) our state, our hearths, our sepulchres, and our
altars.

Through the same plan of conforming to nature in our
artiﬁcial institutions, and by calling on the aid of nature’s
unerring and powerful instincts to strengthen the fallible and
feeble contrivances of our reason, we have derived several
other considerable beneﬁts from seeing our liberties as an
inheritance. The spirit of freedom when left to itself inclines
to misrule and excess, but when it acts as if in the presence
of canonised forefathers it is toned down by an awesome
solemnity. This idea of a liberal descent [i.e. the idea that our
freedom is something that has come down to us] inspires us with a
sense of habitual native dignity which prevents the upstart
insolence that almost inevitably infects and disgraces those
who are the ﬁrst acquirers of any distinction. By this means
our liberty becomes a noble freedom.

It carries an imposing and majestic aspect.

and its ensigns armorial. It has its gallery of portraits, its

We procure reverence to our civil institutions on the principle

18

Reﬂections on the Revolution in France

Edmund Burke

Part 1

upon which nature teaches us to revere individual men: on
account of their age and on account of those from whom
they are descended. All your logic-choppers can’t produce
anything better adapted to preserve a rational and manly
[see Glossary] freedom than the course that we have pursued,
choosing our nature rather than our theories, our hearts
rather than our inventions, as the great conservatories and
store-houses of our rights and privileges.

How France missed its opportunity

You could have proﬁted from our example and given to
your recovered freedom a corresponding dignity. Your priv-
ileges, though they had been discontinued, were not lost
to memory. It’s true that while you were out of possession
your constitution suffered waste and dilapidation; but you
possessed some of the walls and all the foundations of a
noble and venerable castle. You could have repaired those
walls, and built on those old foundations. Your constitution
was suspended before it was ﬁnished, but you had the
elements of a constitution very nearly as good as could be
wished. In your old states [see Glossary] you possessed

•that variety of parts corresponding with the various
descriptions [see Glossary] of which your community
was happily composed;
•all that combination and all that opposition of inter-
ests;
•that action and counteraction which, in the natural
world and the political one, draws out the harmony
of the universe from the struggle amongst discordant
powers.

These opposed and conﬂicting interests, which you saw as
such a great blemish in your old constitution and in our
present one, call a healthy halt to all precipitate decisions.

They make deliberation a matter of necessity, not of choice;
they make all change a subject of compromise, which nat-
urally begets moderation; they produce temperaments that
•prevent the sore evil of harsh, crude, unqualiﬁed refor-
mations, and •make all the headlong exertions of arbitrary
power—whether in the few or in the many—for ever imprac-
ticable. Through that diversity of members and interests,
general liberty had as many securities as there were separate
views in the various parts of society, while the separate parts
would have been prevented from warping and jumping out
of their allotted places by the downward pressure on them of
a real monarchy.

You had all these advantages in your ancient states, but
you chose to act as if you had never been molded into civil
society and had to begin everything anew. You began badly
by despising everything that belonged to you, setting up
in trade without any capital.
If the recent generations of
your country struck you as not very distinguished, you
could have passed them by and derived your claims from an
earlier race of ancestors. Piously favouring those ancestors,
your imaginations would have found in them a standard of
virtue and wisdom beyond the vulgar practice of the present;
and, setting them as the example you wanted to imitate,
you would have risen. Respecting your forefathers, you
would have learned to respect yourselves. You wouldn’t have
chosen to consider the French as a people of yesterday, as
a nation of lowborn servile wretches until the emancipating
year of 1789. You would not have been content to be
represented as

a gang of runaway slaves suddenly broken loose from
the house of bondage and therefore to be pardoned for
your abuse of the liberty that you weren’t accustomed
to or well ﬁtted for,

19

Reﬂections on the Revolution in France

Edmund Burke

Part 1

—a representation that you did allow, at the expense of your
honour, as an excuse to your English defenders for various of
your crimes. Wouldn’t it have been wiser, my worthy friend,
to have people think (as I for one always have thought)

•that you are a generous and gallant nation, long mis-
led to your disadvantage by your high and romantic
sentiments of ﬁdelity, honour, and loyalty;
•that events had been unfavourable to you, but that
you were not enslaved through any anti-freedom or
servile disposition;
•that in your most devoted submission you were
actuated by a principle of public spirit, and that it
was your country you worshipped in the person of
your king?

If you had made people understand that in the delusion
of this amiable error you had gone further than your wise
ancestors, that you were resolved to resume your ancient
privileges while preserving the spirit of your ancient and your
recent loyalty and honour; or if, unsure of yourselves and
not clearly seeing the almost obliterated constitution of your
ancestors, you had looked to your neighbours in England
who had kept alive the ancient principles and models of the
old common law of Europe, improved and adapted to its
present state; either way, by following wise examples you
would have given new examples of wisdom to the world. You
would have

•made the cause of liberty venerable in the eyes of
every worthy mind in every nation;
•shamed despotism from the earth by showing that
freedom is not only reconcilable with law but helpful
to law;
•had an unoppressive but productive revenue;
•had a ﬂourishing commerce to feed it;
•had a free constitution, a potent monarchy, a

disciplined army, a reformed and venerated clergy,
a friendlier but spirited nobility to lead your virtue,
not to oppress it;
•had a liberal order [see Glossary] of commons to emulate
and to recruit that nobility;
•had a protected, satisﬁed, hard-working and obedient
people, taught to seek and to recognise the happiness
that is to be found by virtue in all conditions.

I’m talking about the virtue that involves the true moral
equality of mankind, and not that monstrous ﬁction which—
by giving false ideas and vain expectations to men destined
to travel in the obscure path of working life—serves only to
intensify and embitter the real inequality that it never can
remove and that the order of civil life establishes as much
for the beneﬁt of •those it must leave in a humble state as
•those it raises to a condition more splendid but not more
happy. You had a smooth and easy career of happiness and
glory laid open to you, beyond anything in the history of the
world; but difﬁculty is good for man, as your example shows.

The harm the French revolution has done

Compute your gains: see what is achieved by those ex-
travagant and presumptuous theories that have taught
your leaders to despise •all their predecessors, •all their
contemporaries, and even •themselves until the moment
when they became truly despicable! By following those
false lights, France has bought undisguised calamities at
a higher price than any nation has purchased the most
unequivocal blessings! France has bought poverty by crime!
France hasn’t sacriﬁced her virtue to her interests, but
abandoned her interests so that she might prostitute her
virtue. All other nations have begun the structure of a new
government or the reform of an old one by establishing

originally, or by enforcing with greater exactness, some rites
of religion. All other people have laid the foundations of
civil freedom in stricter manners and a system of a more
austere and vigorous morality. France, when she let loose the
reins of regal authority, doubled the license of a ferocious
dissoluteness in manners and of an insolent irreligion in
opinions and practice, and has extended through all levels of
society—as though distributing some privilege or laying open
some previously restricted beneﬁt—all the corruptions that
have usually been the disease of wealth and power. This is
one of the new principles of equality in France!

France, through the treachery of her leaders, has. . . .given
support to the dark, suspicious maxims of tyrannical dis-
trust, and taught kings to tremble at what will from now
on be called the ‘delusive plausibilities’ of moral politicians.
Sovereigns will regard those who advise them to place un-
limited conﬁdence in their people as subverters of their
thrones, as traitors who aim at their destruction by leading
their easy good-nature to allow combinations of bold and
faithless men to have a share in their power. This alone is an
irreparable calamity to you and to mankind. Remember that
your parliament of Paris told your king that in calling the
states together he had nothing to fear but the extravagant
excess of their zeal in providing for the support of the throne.
It is right that these men should hide their heads.
It is
right that they should bear their part in the ruin that their
counsel has brought on their sovereign and their country.
Such soothing declarations tend to lull authority to sleep;
to encourage it to engage rashly in perilous adventures of
untried policy; to neglect the provisions, preparations, and
precautions which distinguish benevolence from idiocy and
without which no man can answer for the salutary effect
of any abstract plan of government or of freedom. For lack
of these they have seen the medicine of the state go bad

and become its poison. They have seen the French rebel
against a mild and lawful monarch with more fury, outrage,
and insult than ever any people has been known to rise
against the most illegal usurper or the most bloody tyrant.
Their resistance was made to concession, their revolt was
from protection, their blow was aimed at a hand holding out
graces, favours, and immunities.

This was unnatural. What followed is not. They have

found their punishment in their success:

•laws overturned;
•tribunals subverted;
•industry without vigour;
•commerce expiring;
•taxes unpaid, yet the people impoverished;
•a church pillaged, and a state not relieved;
•civil and military anarchy made the constitution of
the kingdom;
•everything human and divine sacriﬁced to the idol
of public credit, with national bankruptcy as the
consequence;

and, to crown everything, the paper securities of new, pre-
carious, tottering power—the discredited paper securities
of impoverished fraud and beggared robbery—held out as
a currency for the support of an empire in place of the
two great recognised species that represent the lasting,
conventional credit of mankind. These two—·silver and
gold·—disappeared and hid themselves in the earth from
which they came, when the principle of ownership (whose
creatures and representatives they are) was systematically
subverted.

Were all these dreadful things necessary? Were they the
inevitable results of the desperate struggle of determined
patriots, compelled to wade through blood and tumult to the
quiet shore of a quiet and prosperous liberty? No! nothing

like it. The fresh ruins of France, which shock our feelings
wherever we can turn our eyes, are not the devastation
of civil war; they are the sad but instructive monuments of
rash and ignorant thinking in a time of profound peace. They
are the display of authority that is rash and presumptuous
because unresisted and irresistible. The persons who have
thus squandered the precious treasure of their crimes, the
persons who have made this extravagant and wild waste of
public evils (the last stake reserved for the ultimate ransom
of the state), have in their progress met with little or no
opposition. Their whole march was more like a triumphal
procession than the progress of a war. Their road-makers
have gone ahead of them and demolished and laid everything
level at their feet. Not one drop of their own blood have
they shed in the cause of the country they have ruined.
They have made no sacriﬁces of greater consequence than
their shoebuckles while they were imprisoning their king,
murdering their fellow citizens, and bathing in tears and
plunging in poverty and distress thousands of worthy men
and worthy families. Their cruelty has not even been the
morally low result of fear. It has been the effect of their sense
of perfect safety in authorising treasons, robberies, rapes,
assassinations, slaughters, and burnings throughout their
harassed land. But the cause of it all was plain from the
beginning.

This unforced choice, this foolish choice of evil, would
seem perfectly inexplicable if we didn’t consider the com-
position of the National Assembly. I don’t mean its formal
constitution—which as it now stands is bad enough—but
the materials of which it is mostly composed, this being ten
thousand times more important than all the formalities in
the world. If we knew nothing of this assembly but its title
and function, no colours could paint to the imagination
In that light the mind of an
anything more venerable.

inquirer, subdued by such an awe-inspiring image as that
of the virtue and wisdom of a whole people brought together
into a focus, would pause and hesitate to condemn even
the things that looked worst. Instead of being blameworthy
they would appear only to be mysterious. But no name, no
power, no function, no artiﬁcial institution whatsoever can
turn the men who compose any system of authority into
something other than what they have been made by God,
nature, education, and their habits of life. The people don’t
have the power to give ·their representatives· any capacities
but these. Virtue and wisdom may be the objects of the
people’s choice, but their choice doesn’t confer either virtue
or wisdom on those upon whom they lay their ordaining
hands. They do not have the engagement of nature or the
promise of revelation for any such powers.

The Third Estate: common people

After I had read over the list of the persons and descriptions
[see Glossary] elected into the Third Estate [see Glossary], noth-
ing that they afterwards did could astonish me. I did indeed
see among them some of known rank, and some of shining
talents; but not one with any •practical experience in the
state. The best were only men of •theory. But whatever
the distinguished few may have been, it is the substance
and mass of the body that constitutes its character and
must ﬁnally determine its direction. In all bodies, those who
wish to lead must also to a considerable extent follow. They
must make their proposals conform to the taste, talent, and
disposition of those whom they wish to lead; so if an assembly
is viciously or feebly composed in a very great part of it, the
men of talent disseminated through it will become merely
the expert instruments of absurd projects! They might be
saved from this by having a supreme degree of virtue, but

22

Reﬂections on the Revolution in France

Edmund Burke

Part 1

this would be a level of virtue that very rarely appears in the
world, and for that reason cannot enter into calculation [the
last eight words are Burke’s]. Or if the men of talent are actuated
by sinister ambition and a lust for meretricious [see Glossary]
glory, then the feeble part of the assembly, to whom at ﬁrst
they conform, becomes in its turn the dupe and instrument
of their designs. In this political trafﬁc, the leaders will be
obliged to bow to the ignorance of their followers, and the
followers to become subservient to the worst designs of their
leaders.

If the leaders in any public assembly are to be in the
least reasonable in the proposals they make, they need
to respect—to some extent perhaps to fear—those whom
they lead. To be led other than blindly, the followers must
be qualiﬁed if not to act then at least to judge; and as
judges they must have natural weight and authority. The
only way to secure steady and moderate conduct in such
assemblies is for the body of them to be made up of people
who are respect-worthy in their condition in life or permanent
property, their education, and their having habits of the sort
that enlarge and liberalise the understanding.

In the calling of the States-General [see Glossary] of France,
the ﬁrst thing that struck me was a great departure from
the old way of doing things. I found the representation for
the Third Estate to be composed of six hundred persons, as
many as the other two orders [see Glossary] put together. If the
orders were to act separately, the number wouldn’t matter
much except for the expense. But when it became apparent
that the three orders were to be melted down into one, the
policy and necessary effect of this numerous representation
became obvious. A very small desertion from either of the
other two orders must throw the power of both into the
hands of the third. In fact, the whole power of the state was
soon resolved into that body, ·the Third Estate·, so that its

composition became inﬁnitely more important.

Judge of my surprise, Sir, when I found that a great pro-
portion of the assembly (a majority, I believe, of the members
who attended) was composed of practising lawyers—

•not of distinguished magistrates who had given
pledges to their country of their science, prudence,
and integrity;
•not of leading advocates, the glory of the bar;
•not of renowned professors in universities

—but mostly of the inferior, unlearned, mechanical, merely
instrumental members of the legal profession (how could
it be otherwise in such a large number?). There were
distinguished exceptions, but mostly they were

•obscure provincial advocates,
•stewards of petty local jurisdictions,
•country attorneys,
•notaries, and
•the whole train of the servants of municipal litigation,
the fomenters and conductors of the petty war of
village vexation.

From the moment I read the list I saw distinctly all that was
to follow, saw it very nearly as it has in fact happened.

The esteem that the members of any profession have
for themselves is based on the esteem that outsiders have
for that profession. Whatever the personal merits of many
individual lawyers might have been (and in many they were
undoubtedly very considerable), in that military kingdom no
part of the profession had been much regarded except the
highest of all, who often combined their professional roles
with great family splendour and were invested with great
power and authority. These certainly were highly respected,
even with a considerable level of awe. Those in the next level
down were not much esteemed; and the mechanical ·part of
the legal profession· was at a very low level of repute.

23

Reﬂections on the Revolution in France

Edmund Burke

Part 1

When supreme authority is given to a body composed in
that way, it is being placed in the hands of men •who haven’t
been taught habitually to respect themselves, •who don’t
have reputations for good character that they risk losing, and
•who can’t be expected to bear with moderation or exercise
with discretion a power that they themselves (more than
any others) must be surprised to ﬁnd in their hands. Who
could soothe himself with the hopeful thought that these
men, suddenly and (as it were) magically snatched from the
humblest rank of subordination, would not be intoxicated
by their unexpected greatness? Who could conceive that
men who are habitually meddling, daring, subtle, active,
with litigious dispositions and unquiet minds would easily
fall back into their old condition of obscure contention and
laborious, low, unproﬁtable trickery? Who could doubt that
they would—at any expense to the state (of which they un-
derstood nothing)—pursue their private interests (which they
understand all too well)? This wasn’t an outcome depending
on chance or contingency: it was inevitable; it was necessary;
it was planted in the nature of things. If they didn’t have the
talents needed to lead, they must at least join in any project
that could procure for them a litigious constitution, opening
up to them the countless lucrative jobs [see Glossary] that
follow all great convulsions and revolutions in the state, and
particularly in all great and violent permutations of property.
Was it to be expected that they would attend to the stability of
property, these people whose existence had always depended
on whatever made property questionable, ambiguous, and
insecure? Their objectives would be broadened with their
rise ·to power·, but their disposition and habits, and their
way of accomplishing their designs, must remain the same.
Well! but these men were to be tempered and restrained
by the views of other descriptions [see Glossary] with more
sober and more enlarged understandings. Were they then to

be awed by the super-eminent authority and awe-inspiring
dignity of •a handful of country clowns who have seats in
that assembly, some of whom are said not to be able to
read and write, and by traders who, though somewhat more
instructed and more conspicuous in the order of society, had
never known anything beyond their counting house? No!
Both these descriptions were formed to be overborne and
swayed by the intrigues and artiﬁces of lawyers rather than
to become their counterpoise. . . . To the faculty of law was
joined a considerable proportion of the faculty of medicine. In
France this faculty wasn’t esteemed as it should have been,
any more than the law was; so its practitioners must have
the qualities of men not habituated to a sense of dignity. But
supposing they had ranked as they ought to do, and as in
England they do actually, ·that would deal with the ‘dignity’
point, but still wouldn’t ﬁt them for parliament·: the sides of
sickbeds are not the academies for forming statesmen and
legislators. Then came the dealers in stocks and funds, who
must be eager at any cost to change their notional paper
wealth for the more solid substance of land. All these were
joined by men of other descriptions, men from whom as little
knowledge of (or attention to) the interests of a great state
was to be expected, and as little regard to the stability of
any institution; men formed to be instruments, not controls.
Such in general was the composition of the Third Estate in
the National Assembly, in which one could hardly see the
slightest traces of what we call the natural landed interest of
the country.

The British House of Commons

We know that the British House of Commons, though it
doesn’t shut its doors to any merit in any class, is—by
the sure operation of adequate causes—ﬁlled with every-

24

Reﬂections on the Revolution in France

Edmund Burke

Part 1

thing illustrious in rank, in descent, in hereditary and
acquired afﬂuence, in cultivated talents, in military, civil,
naval, and political distinction that the country can provide.
But suppose (though it’s almost impossible to suppose)
that the House of Commons were composed in the same
way as the Third Estate in France, would this dominion
of trickery be borne with patience or even thought about
without horror? God forbid I should insinuate anything
derogatory to ·the lawyers·, that profession that is another
priesthood, administering the rights of sacred justice. But
while I revere lawyers in the functions that belong to them,
and would do all I could prevent their exclusion from any
role, I cannot ﬂatter them by giving the lie to nature. They
are good and useful as members of an assembly; they must
be harmful if they preponderate so as virtually to become
the whole. The very qualities that make them excellent in
their professional functions may strike others as far from a
qualiﬁcation. It can’t escape notice that when men are too
much conﬁned to professional and faculty habits. . . ., they
are disabled rather than qualiﬁed for whatever depends on
the knowledge of mankind, on experience in mixed affairs, on
a comprehensive, connected view of the various, complicated,
external and internal interests that go to the formation of
that multifarious thing called a state.

If the House of Commons were to have a wholly pro-
fessional and faculty composition, what is its power when
•circumscribed and shut in by the immovable barriers
of laws, usages, positive rules of doctrine and practice,
•counterpoised by the House of Lords, and at every moment
•at the discretion of the crown to continue, prorogue, or
dissolve it? The direct and indirect power of the House of
Commons is indeed great; and long may it be able to preserve
fully its greatness and the spirit belonging to true greatness;
and it will do so as long as it can keep the breakers of law

in India from becoming the makers of law for England [look
up ‘Warren Hastings’ in Wikipedia]. Yet the power of the House
of Commons at its greatest is as a drop of water in the
ocean compared to the power residing in a settled majority
of your National Assembly. Since the destruction of the
orders—·i.e. the coalescing of the separate assemblies of the
three Estates·—the National Assembly has no fundamental
law, no strict convention, no respected usage to restrain it.
Instead of ﬁnding themselves obliged to make their designs
conform to a ﬁxed constitution they have the power to make
a constitution that conforms to their designs. Nothing in
heaven or on earth can serve as a control on them. What
ought to be the heads, hearts and dispositions that are
qualiﬁed—or that dare—not only to make laws under a ﬁxed
constitution but in one operations to make a totally new
constitution for a great kingdom and for every part of it from
the monarch on the throne to the vestry of a parish? But
‘fools rush in where angels fear to tread’. In such a state
of unlimited power for undeﬁnable purposes, the evil of a
moral and almost physical unﬁttingness of the man to the
function must be the greatest we can conceive to happen in
the management of human affairs.

The First Estate: the clergy

Having considered the composition of the Third Estate in its
original form, I looked at the representatives of the clergy.
The principles of their election seemed to show just as
little regard for the general security of property or for the
aptitude of the deputies for public purposes. That election
was so constructed that it sent a very large proportion of
mere country curates to the great and arduous work of
new-modeling a state: men who. . . .knew nothing of the world
beyond the bounds of an obscure village; who, immersed in

25

Reﬂections on the Revolution in France

Edmund Burke

Part 1

hopeless poverty, could regard all property—whether secular
or ecclesiastical—with no eye but that of envy; among whom
must be many who, for the smallest hope of the smallest
dividend in plunder, would readily join in any assaults on
a body of wealth that they could hardly expect to have any
share in except through a general scramble.
Instead of
balancing the power of the active tricksters in the other
assembly, these curates are bound to become the active
collaborators or at best the passive instruments of those
they had habitually been guided by in their petty village
concerns. And they could hardly be the most conscientious
of their kind, these village priests who, presuming on their
incompetent understanding, could intrigue to get a trust that
led them from their natural relation to their ﬂocks and their
natural spheres of action to undertake the regeneration of
kingdoms! When their great weight was added to the force
of the body of trickery in the Third Estate, that completed a
momentum of ignorance, rashness, presumption, and lust
for plunder that nothing has been able to resist.

The Second Estate: the nobility

To observing men it must have seemed from the beginning
that the majority of the Third Estate, in conjunction with a
deputation from the clergy such as I have described, while
it pursued the destruction of •the nobility would inevitably
become subservient to the worst designs of individuals in
•that class. In the spoil and humiliation of their own order,
these individuals would possess a secure fund for the pay of
their new followers. Squandering away the things that made
the happiness of their fellows ·in the nobility· would to them
be no sacriﬁce at all. Turbulent, discontented men of high
rank, in proportion as they are puffed up with personal pride
and arrogance, generally despise their own order. One of

the ﬁrst symptoms they reveal of a selﬁsh and mischievous
ambition is a proﬂigate disregard of the dignity they share
with others. To. . . .love the little platoon we belong to in
society is the ﬁrst principle [see Glossary] (the germ as it were)
of public affections. It is the ﬁrst link in the chain by which
we move toward a love to our country and to mankind. The
interests of that portion of social arrangement (·the ‘little
platoon’ we belong to·) are a trust in the hands of all those
who compose it; and just as only bad men would justify it
in abuse, only traitors would barter it away for their own
personal advantage.

At the time of our civil troubles in England (·the war
between Cromwell’s forces and King Charles I’s·) there were
several persons like the Earl of Holland who had brought
hatred on the throne by the extravagance of its gifts to them
or their families, and then joined in the rebellions arising
from the discontents of which they were themselves the
cause; men who helped to subvert the throne to which some
of them owed their existence and others owed all the power
that they used to ruin their benefactor. (I don’t know whether
you have any such in your assembly in France.)
If any
limits are set to the rapacious demands of such people, or
if others are permitted share in things they want the whole
of, revenge and envy soon ﬁll up the aching craving void
that is left in their greed. Confused by the complication of
sick passions, their reason is disturbed; their views become
vast and perplexed; to others inexplicable, to themselves
uncertain. In any ﬁxed order of things they ﬁnd limits to
their unprincipled ambition; in the fog and haze of confusion
everything is enlarged and appears to them to be without
any limit.

When men of rank sacriﬁce all ideas of dignity to an ambi-
tion with no clear objective, and work with low instruments
for low ends, the whole composition becomes low and base.

26

Part 1

Does not something like this now appear in France? Doesn’t
it produce something ignoble and inglorious—a kind of
meanness in all the prevalent policy, a tendency in everything
that is done to lower, along with individuals, all the dignity
and importance of the state? Other revolutions have been
conducted by persons who, while they tried to make changes
in the commonwealth, sanctiﬁed their ambition by advancing
the dignity of the people whose peace they were disturbing.
They took the long view. They aimed at the rule of their
country, not at its destruction. They were men of great civil
and great military talents—the terror of their age but also its
ornament. . . . The compliment made to one of the great bad
men of the old kind (Cromwell) by his kinsman, a favourite
poet of that time, shows what it was that he proposed and
indeed to a great degree accomplished in the success of his
ambition:

Still as you rise, the state exalted too,
Finds no distemper while ’tis changed by you;
Changed like the world’s great scene, when with-

out noise

The rising sun night’s vulgar lights destroys.

These disturbers were less like men usurping power than
like men asserting their natural place in society. Their rise
was to illuminate and beautify the world. Their conquest
over their competitors was by outshining them. The hand
that struck the country like a destroying angel passed on
to it the force and energy under which it suffered.
I do
not say (God forbid), I do not say that the virtues of such
men outweighed their crimes, but they were some corrective
to the effects of their crimes. Such was, as I said, our
Cromwell. Such were your whole race of Guises, Condés,
and Colignis. Such the Richelieus, who in quieter times

acted in the spirit of a civil war. Such—as better men and in
a less dubious cause—were your Henry IV and your Sully,
though nursed in civil confusions and not wholly untainted
by them. It is a thing to be wondered at to see how very
soon France, when she had a moment to catch her breath,
recovered and emerged from the longest and most dreadful
civil war that ever was known in any nation [this presumably
refers to the French wars of religion, 1562–98]. Why? Because
among all their massacres they hadn’t slain the mind in
their country. A conscious dignity, a noble pride, a generous
sense of glory and emulation [= ‘trying to do better’] was not
extinguished. On the contrary, it was kindled and inﬂamed.
And the organs of the state, however shattered, still existed.
All the prizes of honour and virtue, all the rewards, all the
distinctions remained. But your present confusion, like a
palsy [= something like ‘an epileptic ﬁt’], has attacked the fountain
of life itself. Every French person who is in a situation
to be actuated by a principle of honour is disgraced and
degraded, and can’t look at life in anything but mortiﬁed and
humiliated indignation. But this generation will quickly pass
away. The next generation of the ‘nobility’ will resemble the
artiﬁcers and clowns, and the money-jobbers and Jewish
usurers, who will be always their fellows, sometimes their
masters.

The importance of property

Believe me, Sir, those who attempt to level never equalise.
In all societies consisting of various descriptions of citizens,
some description must be uppermost. So the levellers are
only changing and perverting the natural order of things;
they are loading the ediﬁce of society by setting up in the
air what the solidity of the structure requires to be on the
ground. The association of tailors and carpenters that the

27

Reﬂections on the Revolution in France

Edmund Burke

Part 1

republic (of Paris, for instance) is composed of cannot be
equal to the situation into which you try to force them by
the worst of usurpations, a usurpation on the prerogatives
of nature.

The Chancellor of France, at the opening of the states,
said in a tone of oratorical ﬂourish that all occupations were
honourable. If he meant only that no honest employment
is disgraceful, he wouldn’t have gone beyond the truth. But
in asserting that something is ‘honourable’ we imply some
distinction in its favour. The occupation of a hairdresser
or of a working candle-maker can’t be a matter of honour
to anyone—not to mention a number of other more servile
employments. Such descriptions of men ought not to suffer
oppression from the state; but the state suffers oppression
if the likes of them, either individually or collectively, are
permitted to rule.
In this you think you are combating
prejudice, but actually you are at war with nature. . . .

I don’t wish to conﬁne power, authority, and distinction
to blood and names and titles. There is no qualiﬁcation
for government but actual or presumed virtue and wisdom.
Wherever they are actually found, in whatever state, condi-
tion, profession, or trade, they have the passport of Heaven to
human position and honour. Woe to the country that would
•madly and impiously reject the service of the talents and
virtues—civil, military, or religious—that are given to grace
and service, and •condemn to obscurity everything formed
to spread lustre and glory around a state. Woe also to the
country that goes to the opposite extreme and considers a
low education, a mean contracted view of things, a sordid,
mercenary occupation as a preferable title to command.
Everything ought to be open, but not equally, to every man.
No •rotation or •appointment by lot or •system of taking
turns can be generally good in a government that has a wide
range of things to do, because they have no tendency—direct

or indirect—to select the man with a view to the duty or
adjust the duty to ﬁt the man. I don’t hesitate to say that the
road to eminence and power ought not to be made too easy,
or too much a matter of course. If rare merit is the rarest of
all rare things, it ought to pass through some sort of testing
period. The temple of honour ought to be seated on a high
hill. If it is to be opened through virtue, let it be remembered
that virtue is never tested except by some difﬁculty and some
struggle.

An appropriate and adequate representation of a state
must represent its ability as well as its property. But ability
is a vigorous and active principle [see Glossary], whereas
property is sluggish, inert, and timid; so property never
can be safe from the invasion of ability unless it is—out of all
proportion—predominant in the representation. And it won’t
be rightly protected unless it is represented in great masses
of accumulation [i.e. unless the parliament includes people who are
very wealthy]. The way property is acquired, combined with
the way it is conserved, makes it an essential characteristic
of property that it is not equally distributed. So the great
masses that excite envy and tempt robbery must be put
out reach of danger. Then they form a natural rampart
surrounding ·and protecting· lesser properties of all sizes.
That could not be achieved by the same amount of property
·as the great fortunes have· divided among many people.
Its defensive power is weakened because it is diffused. In
this diffusion each man’s portion is less than what he opti-
mistically hopes to obtain by dissipating the accumulations
of others, ·speciﬁcally, of those who own very much more·.
Plundering the few and distributing their wealth among the
many would in fact give each of them only an inconceivably
small share. But the many are not capable of making this
calculation; and those who lead them to robbery never intend
this distribution.

The power of perpetuating our property in our families
is one of the most valuable and interesting circumstances
belonging to it, and that which tends the most to the perpet-
uation of society itself. It makes our weakness subservient
to our virtue, it grafts benevolence even upon avarice. The
possessors of family wealth, and of the distinction that goes
with hereditary possession. are the natural securities for this
transmission. Our House of Lords is formed on this principle.
It is wholly composed of hereditary property and hereditary
distinction; it is one third of the legislature, and in the last
event the sole judge of all property in all its subdivisions. The
House of Commons is also, in fact (though not necessarily),
always mostly made up of wealthy people. Let those large
proprietors be what they will—and they have their chance of
being among the best—they are at the very worst the ballast
in the vessel of the commonwealth. For though hereditary
wealth and the rank that goes with it are too much idolised by
creeping sycophants and the blind, abject admirers of power,
they are too rashly slighted in the shallow theories of the
petulant, presumptuous, short-sighted idiots of philosophy.
To give some decent, regulated pre-eminence—some prefer-
ence (not exclusive appropriation)—to birth is not unnatural,
or unjust, or bad policy.

Dismembering a country

It is said that 24,000,000 ought to prevail over 200,000.
True;
if the constitution of a kingdom is a problem of
arithmetic! This sort of discourse does well enough with
the lamp-post for its second; but to men who reason calmly
it is ridiculous.
[This refers to the practice of French revolutionary
mobs lynching people by hanging them from lamp-posts.] The •will
of the many must very often differ from their •interests,
and when they make an evil choice the difference will be

great. A government of 500 country attorneys and obscure
curates is not good for 24,000,000 men, even if it were
chosen by 48,000,000 voters, nor is it the better for being
guided by a dozen persons of quality—·of wealth and high
birth·—who have betrayed their trust in order to obtain that
power. At present, you seem in everything to have strayed
out of the high road of nature. The property of France does
not govern it. Property is destroyed and rational liberty
has no existence. All you have got for the present is paper
money and a stock-jobbing constitution [i.e. one designed to
support buying and selling for a quick proﬁt]; and as to the future,
do you seriously think that the territory of France, on the
republican system of eighty-three independent municipalities
(to say nothing of the parts that compose them), can ever
be governed as one body or can ever be set in motion by
the impulse of one mind? When the National Assembly has
completed its work, it will have accomplished its ruin. These
commonwealths will not for long put up with being subjected
to the republic of Paris. They won’t put up with this body’s
monopolising the captivity of the king and the dominion
over the assembly calling itself ‘national’. Each will keep to
itself a portion of the spoils of the church, and it won’t allow
those spoils, or the more just fruits of their industry, or the
natural produce of their soil, to be sent to swell the insolence
or pamper the luxury of the mechanics of Paris. They won’t
see in this any of the promised equality that tempted them
to throw off their allegiance to their sovereign as well as
the ancient constitution of their country. There can be no
capital city in a constitution such as the revolutionaries have
recently made. They have forgotten that when they formed
democratic governments they virtually dismembered their
country. The person whom they persevere in calling ‘king’
doesn’t have a hundredth part of the power needed to hold
together this collection of republics. The republic of Paris

29

Part 1

will indeed try •to complete the army’s debauchery [here =
the soldiers’ refusal to obey their ofﬁcers] and •to perpetuate the
assembly illegally, without resort to its constituents, as the
means of continuing its despotism. It will make efforts, by
becoming the heart of a ﬁnancial system based on paper
money, to draw everything to itself; but in vain. All this
policy will eventually appear as feeble as it is now violent.

If this is your actual situation, compared to the one you
were called to by the voice of God and man (so to speak),
I can’t ﬁnd it in my heart to congratulate you on the choice
you have made or the success that your endeavours have had.
Nor can I recommend to any other nation a conduct grounded
on such principles and productive of such effects. I must
leave that to those who can see further into your affairs
than I can, and who best know how far your actions are
favourable to their designs. The gentlemen of the Revolution
Society who were so early in their congratulations appear to
be convinced that there is some scheme of politics relating
to this country in which your proceedings may somehow be
useful. Your Dr Price seems to have theorised himself into
no small degree of fervour on this subject, and addresses his
audience in the following remarkable words:

‘I cannot conclude without recalling particularly to
your recollection a consideration that I have more
than once alluded to, and that probably your thoughts
have been all along anticipating; a consideration with
which my mind is impressed more than I can express.
I mean the consideration of the favourableness of the
present times to all exertions in the cause of liberty.’
Clearly this political preacher’s mind was at the time preg-
nant with some extraordinary design; and it is very probable
that the thoughts of his audience, who understood him better
than I do, did ‘all along’ run ahead of him in his reﬂection
and in the whole sequence of inferences to which it led.

Before reading that sermon I really thought I lived in a
free country; and it was an error that I cherished because
it gave me a greater liking for the country I lived in. I was,
indeed, aware that a jealous, ever-waking vigilance to guard
the treasure of our liberty, not only from invasion but also
from decay and corruption, was our best wisdom and our
ﬁrst duty. But I considered that treasure as a possession
to be kept safe rather than as a prize to be contended for. I
didn’t see how the present time came to be so very favourable
to ‘all exertions in the cause of freedom’. The present time
differs from any other only in what is happening in France.
If that nation’s example is to have an inﬂuence on this, I can
easily understand why some of their doings—the ones that
have an unpleasant aspect and are not quite reconcilable to
humanity, generosity, good faith, and justice—are palliated
with so much milky good-nature toward the actors, and
borne with so much heroic fortitude toward the sufferers.
It is certainly not prudent to discredit the authority of an
example we mean to follow. But allowing this, we are led to
a very natural question: What is that cause of liberty, and
what are those exertions in its favour to which the example
of France is so singularly favourable? Is our monarchy to be
annihilated, along with all the laws, all the tribunals, and all
the ancient corporations of the kingdom? Is every landmark
of the country to be done away in favour of a geometrical
and arithmetical constitution? Is the House of Lords to be
voted useless? Is episcopacy to be abolished? Are the church
lands to be sold to Jews and real-estate merchants or used to
bribe newly-invented municipal republics into participating
in the sacrilege? Are all the taxes to be voted grievances, and
the revenue reduced to a patriotic contribution or patriotic
presents? Are silver shoe-buckles to be substituted in the
place of the land tax and the malt tax for the support of the
naval strength of this kingdom? Are all orders, ranks, and

30

Reﬂections on the Revolution in France

Edmund Burke

Part 1

distinctions to be run together so that out of universal anar-
chy, joined to national bankruptcy, three or four thousand
democracies should be formed into eighty-three, and that
they may all be drawn together by some unknown attractive
power into one?

For this great end, is the army to be seduced from its
discipline and its ﬁdelity, ﬁrst by every kind of debauchery
and then by the terrible precedent of a donative in the
increase of pay? Are the curates to be seduced from their
bishops by holding out to them the delusive hope of a pension
out of the spoils of their own order? Are the citizens of
London to be drawn from their allegiance by feeding them
at the expense of their fellow subjects? Is compulsory paper
money to be substituted for the legal coin of this kingdom?
Is what remains of the plundered stock of public revenue
to be used in the wild project of maintaining two armies to
watch over and to ﬁght with each other? If these are the ends
and means of the Revolution Society, I admit that. . . .France
may provide them with relevant precedents.

How the Revolution Society views the British
constitution

I see that your example is held out to shame us. I know that
we British are supposed to be a dull, sluggish race, made
passive by ﬁnding our situation tolerable, and prevented
by our semi-freedom from ever attaining freedom in its full
perfection. Your leaders in France began by claiming to
admire, almost to adore, the British constitution; but as
they advanced they came to look on it with lordly contempt.
The friends of your National Assembly among us have just
as low an opinion of what used to be thought the glory
of their country. The Revolution Society has discovered
that the English nation is not free. They are convinced

•that the inequality in our representation is a ‘defect in
our constitution so gross and palpable as to make it excel-
lent chieﬂy in form and theory ·and not in fact·’. •That a
representation in a kingdom’s legislature is the basis not
only of all constitutional liberty in it but of ‘all legitimate
government’; •that without it a government is ‘nothing but
a usurpation’; •that ‘when the representation is partial, the
kingdom has liberty only partially; and if it is extremely
partial, it gives only a semblance ·of representation·; and if it
is corruptly chosen as well as extremely partial, it becomes
a nuisance’ [= ‘becomes positively noxious’]. Dr Price regards this
inadequacy of representation as our ‘fundamental grievance’;
and. . . .he fears that ‘nothing will be done towards gaining
for us this essential blessing until some great abuse of power
again provokes our resentment, or some great calamity again
alarms our fears, or perhaps till the acquisition of a pure
and equal representation by other countries, while we are
mocked with the shadow ·of it·, kindles our shame.’ To
this adds a footnote: ‘A representation chosen chieﬂy by the
treasury and a few thousands of the dregs of the people who
are generally paid for their votes’.

You will smile at the consistency of those democrats
who when they are not on their guard treat the humbler
part of the community with the greatest contempt, while
claiming to make them the depositories of all power. It would
require a long discourse to point out to you all the fallacies
that lurk in the generality and ambiguity of the phrase
‘inadequate representation’. I shall only say here, in justice
to the old-fashioned constitution under which we have long
prospered, that our representation has been found perfectly
adequate for all the purposes for which a representation of
the people can be desired or devised. I defy the enemies of
our constitution to show the contrary. To detail the ways in
which it is found to promote its ends so well I would have

31

Reﬂections on the Revolution in France

Edmund Burke

Part 1

to write a book on our practical constitution. All that I’ll do
here is to state the doctrine of the Revolutionists, so that you
and others may see what these gentlemen think about the
constitution of their country, and why they seem to think
they would feel much better if there were some great abuse
of power or some great calamity, because that would provide
a chance for the blessing of a constitution according to their
ideas; you’ll see why they are so much enamoured of your
‘fair and equal’ representation, which might bring the same
beneﬁts in Britain if we adopted it. You’ll see they consider
our House of Commons as only ‘a semblance’, ‘a form’, ‘a
theory’, ‘a shadow’, ‘a mockery’, perhaps ‘a nuisance’.

These gentlemen pride themselves on being systematic,
and not without reason. So they must look on this gross
and palpable defect of representation, this ‘fundamental
grievance’, as not only being vicious in itself but also making
our whole government absolutely illegitimate—no better than
a downright usurpation. Another revolution to get rid of this
illegitimate and usurped government would of course be
perfectly justiﬁable, if not absolutely necessary.
Indeed,
their principle if taken seriously goes much further than
merely altering the election of the House of Commons; if
popular representation or choice is necessary for the legit-
imacy of all government then the House of Lords is at one
stroke bastardised. . . . That House is not a representative
of the people at all, even in ‘semblance or in form’. And
the situation of the crown is altogether as bad.
In vain
the crown may try to screen itself against these gentlemen
by the authority of the establishment made through the
Revolution ·of 1688·,. . . .because that was made by a House
of Lords representing no-one but themselves, and by a House
of Commons exactly like the present one—i.e. by a mere
‘shadow and mockery’ of representation.

They must destroy something, or they’ll seem to them-
selves to exist for no purpose. One set favours destroying
the civil power through the ecclesiastical; another wants to
demolish the ecclesiastical through the civil. They’re aware
that this double ruin of church and state might bring the
worst consequences to the public, but they are so heated
with their theories that they indicate—giving more than hints
of this—that this ruin, with all the mischiefs that must lead
to it and come with it, would not be unacceptable to them
or very far remote from their wishes. A man among them of
great authority and certainly of great talents, speaking of a
supposed alliance between church and state, says, ‘perhaps
we must wait for the fall of the civil powers before this most
unnatural alliance be broken. Calamitous that time will no
doubt be. But what convulsion in the political world ought
to be a subject of lamentation if it brings such a desirable
effect?’ You see with what a steady eye these gentlemen are
prepared to view the greatest calamities that can befall their
country!

‘The rights of men’

So it’s no wonder. . . .that they look abroad with eager and
passionate enthusiasm. While they’re in the grip of these
notions it is useless to talk to them of •the practice of their
ancestors, •the fundamental laws of their country, •the
ﬁxed form of a constitution whose merits are conﬁrmed
by the solid test of long experience and an increasing public
strength and national prosperity. They despise experience as
the wisdom of unlettered men; and as for the rest, they have
built and placed underground a mine that will blow up in
one grand explosion all examples of antiquity, all precedents,
charters, and acts of parliament. They have ‘the rights of
men’. Against these there can be no prescription [see Glossary],

32

Reﬂections on the Revolution in France

Part 1

against these no agreement is binding; these admit of no
taming and no compromise; anything withheld from their full
demand is mere fraud and injustice. Against these ‘rights
of men’ of theirs let no government look for security in the
length of its continuance, or in the justice and mildness
of its administration. The objections of these theorists are
as valid against an old and beneﬁcent government (if its
forms don’t square with their theories) as against the most
violent tyranny or the latest usurpation. They are always at
issue with governments, not on a question of abuse but on a
question of competency and a question of title. I have nothing
to say to the clumsy subtlety of their political metaphysics.
Let that be their pastime in the schools. . . . But let them not
break prison to burst like a Levanter [a strong easterly wind in
the Mediterranean] to sweep the earth with their hurricane and
to stir up the fountains of the great deep to overwhelm us.

I am far from denying in theory the real rights of men,
any more than I would want to withhold them in practice if
I had the power to decide. In denying their false claims of
right, I don’t mean to injure those that are real and would be
totally destroyed by their supposed rights . [In that sentence,
‘their’ (twice) refers to ‘these gentlemen’, the members of the Revolution
If civil society is made for the advantage of man,
Society.]
all the advantages for which it is made become his right.
It is an institution of beneﬁcence; and law itself is only
beneﬁcence acting by a rule. Men have a right to live by
that rule; they have a right to do justice, as between their
fellows, whether their fellows have public functions or are
in ordinary occupations. They have a right to the fruits of
their industry and to the means of making their industry
fruitful. They have a right to the acquisitions of their parents,
to the nourishment and improvement of their offspring, to
instruction in life, and to consolation in death. Whatever
each man can separately do without trespassing on others

he has a right to do for himself; and he has a right to a
fair portion of all that society—with all its combinations of
skill and force—can do in his favour. In this partnership all
men have equal rights, but not to equal things. He that has
only ﬁve shillings in the partnership has as good a right to
it as he that has ﬁve hundred pounds in it has to his larger
proportion. But he doesn’t have a right to an equal dividend
in the product of the partnership; and as for the share of
power, authority, and direction that each individual ought
to have in the management of the state, I deny that that is
among the direct original rights of man in civil society; for
I’m talking about the civil social man, and no other. It is a
thing to be settled by convention.

If civil society is the offspring of convention, that conven-
tion must be its law. That convention must limit and modify
all the constitutional details that are formed under it. Every
sort of legislative, judicial, or executive power is created by
it. They can have no existence in any other state of things;
and how can any man claim under the conventions of civil
society rights that don’t so much as suppose the existence
of civil society—rights that are ﬂatly inconsistent with it?
One of the ﬁrst pushes towards civil society, becoming one
of its fundamental rules, is that no man should be judge in
his own cause. By this ·rule· each person has immediately
given up the ﬁrst fundamental right of pre-convention man,
namely to judge for himself and to assert his own cause. He
abdicates all right to be his own governor. To a large extent
he abandons the right of self-defence, the ﬁrst law of nature.
Men can’t enjoy the rights of an uncivil state and of a civil
state together. To obtain justice a man gives up his right of
determining what is just in the matters that are the most
essential to him. To secure some liberty he puts the whole
of his liberty in trust.

The empirical science of government

Government is not made in virtue of natural rights, which
can and do exist in total independence of government and
in that context exist in much greater clearness and in much
more abstract perfection; but their abstract perfection is
their practical defect. By having a right to everything men
want everything. Government is a contrivance of human
wisdom to provide for human wants. Men have a right
that these wants should be provided for by this wisdom.
Among these wants is to be reckoned the want—needed
for civil society—of a sufﬁcient restraint on their passions.
Society requires not only that the passions of individuals
should be held down but also that, even in the mass as
well as in individuals, men’s inclinations should often be
thwarted, their will controlled, and their passions brought
into subjection. This can only be done by a power other than
themselves, a power that exercises its function without itself
being subject to the will and passions that it is supposed to
rein in and subdue. In this sense the restraints on men, as
well as their liberties, are to be reckoned among their rights.
But as the liberties and the restrictions vary with times and
circumstances and admit of countless modiﬁcations, they
can’t be settled through any abstract rule; and nothing is so
foolish as to discuss them on that basis.

The moment you take anything from the full rights of
men—the right of each to govern himself, and not allow any
artiﬁcial, positive [see Glossary] limitation on those rights—
from that moment the whole organisation of government de-
pends on convenience. That is what makes the constitution
of a state and the proper distribution of its powers a matter
involving the most delicate and complicated skill. It requires
a deep knowledge of human nature and human needs, and
of the things that help or obstruct the various ends that

are to be pursued by the mechanism of civil institutions. . . .
What is the use of discussing a man’s abstract right to food
or medicine? The question concerns how to procure and
administer them. In that deliberation I shall always advise
calling in the aid of the farmer and the physician rather than
the professor of metaphysics.

The science of constructing or renovating or reforming
a commonwealth is, like every other experimental science,
not to be taught a priori. And a short experience cannot
instruct us in that practical science, because the real ef-
fects of moral causes [i.e. causes that operate through the feelings
and attitudes of human beings] are not always immediate; and
something that at ﬁrst is prejudicial may be excellent in its
remoter operation, and its excellence may even arise from
the bad effects it has at the start. The reverse also happens:
plausible schemes with pleasing commencements often have
shameful and lamentable conclusions. A great part of a
state’s prosperity or adversity may essentially depend on
obscure and almost latent causes that appear at ﬁrst view to
be quite unimportant. The science of government being so
practical in itself and intended for such practical purposes,
a man should be inﬁnitely cautious about pulling down an
ediﬁce that has for ages satisﬁed the common purposes of
society to some tolerable degree, or building it up again
without having models and patterns of approved utility
before his eyes. Doing this requires experience, and even
more experience than any person can gain in his whole life,
however intelligent and and observant he may be.

These metaphysical ‘rights’ entering into common life, like
rays of light that pierce into a dense medium, are refracted
from their straight line by the laws of nature. Indeed, in the
gross and complicated mass of human passions and con-
cerns the primitive rights of men are refracted and reﬂected
in so many ways that it becomes absurd to talk of them as

34

Reﬂections on the Revolution in France

Edmund Burke

Part 1

if they continued in the simplicity of their original direction.
The nature of man is intricate; the aims of society are of
the greatest possible complexity; so no simple disposition
or direction of power can be suitable to man’s nature or to
the quality of his affairs. When I hear simplicity of structure
aimed at and boasted of in any new political constitution I
immediately conclude that the artiﬁcers are grossly ignorant
of their trade or totally negligent of their duty. The simple
governments are fundamentally defective, to say no worse
of them. Looking at society from just one point of view,
these simple modes of political arrangement are inﬁnitely
captivating; each satisﬁes its single purpose much more
perfectly than any more complex ·arrangement· is able to
attain all its complex purposes. But it is better that the
whole should be achieved imperfectly and not according to
any rule than that some parts should be provided for with
great exactness while others are totally neglected or even
harmed. . . .

The rights these theorists lay claim to are all extremes;
and in proportion as they are metaphysically true they are
morally and politically false. The rights of men are in a
sort of middle, incapable of deﬁnition, but not impossible
to discern. The rights of men in governments are their
advantages; and these are often in balances between varieties
of good, sometimes in compromises between good and evil,
and sometimes between evil and evil. Political reason is a
computing principle: adding, subtracting, multiplying, and
dividing true moral denominations—doing this morally and
not metaphysically or mathematically.

These theorists of ‘rights’ almost always sophistically run
together the people’s right with their power. The body of the
community, whenever it can come to act, can meet with no
effective resistance; but until power and right are the same,
the whole body of them has no right inconsistent with virtue,

the ﬁrst of all virtues being prudence. Men have no right to
what is not reasonable or not for their beneﬁt. . . .

National sickness

[This refers to anniversaries of the 1688 revolution.] The kind of
anniversary sermons to which much of what I write refers, if
men are not shamed out of their present course in com-
memorating the fact, will cheat many people out of the
principles—and deprive them of the beneﬁts—of the rev-
olution they commemorate.
I confess to you, Sir, I never
liked this continual talk of ‘resistance’ and ‘revolution’, or
the practice of making the constitution’s extreme medicine
its daily bread. It renders the habit of society dangerously
valetudinary [i.e. suitable to continuous severe illness]. It is taking
periodical doses of mercury sublimate and swallowing down
repeated stimulants of cantharides to our love of liberty.

This sickness of habitually taking medicines relaxes and
wears out. . . .the mainspring of that spirit that is to be
exerted on great occasions.
It was in the most passive
period of Roman servitude that themes of tyrannicide made
the ordinary exercise of boys at school. . . . In the ordinary
state of things it produces in a country like ours the worst
effects, including effects on the cause of the liberty that it
abuses with the dissoluteness of extravagant speculation.
Almost all the high-bred republicans of my time have soon
become the most decided, thorough-paced courtiers; they
soon left the business of a tedious, moderate, but practical
resistance to those of us whom they have, in the pride and
intoxication of their theories, slighted as not much better
than Tories. Hypocrisy, of course, delights in the most
high-ﬂown theories because it costs nothing to make your
theory magniﬁcent if you don’t intend it to go from theory to
practice. But even in cases where levity rather than fraud

35

Reﬂections on the Revolution in France

Edmund Burke

Part 1

was to be suspected in these ranting speculations, the issue
has been much the same. These professors, ﬁnding that
their extreme principles don’t apply to cases that call only for
a qualiﬁed resistance—a civil and legal resistance—in such
cases employ no resistance at all. For them it is a war or a
revolution, or it is nothing. Finding that their schemes of
politics don’t ﬁt the state of the world they live in, they often
come to think lightly of all public principle, and are ready
to abandon for a very trivial interest what they ﬁnd to be of
very trivial value. Some do have more steady and persevering
natures, but these are eager politicians out of parliament
who have little to tempt them to abandon their favourite
projects. They are constantly aiming at some change in the
church or state, or both. When that is the case, they are
always bad citizens and perfectly unsure connections [= can’t
be relied on for anything]. Regarding their speculative designs
as of inﬁnite value and the actual arrangement of the state
as of no importance, they are at best indifferent about it.
They see no merit in the good management of public affairs
and no fault in the bad. Indeed, they rejoice in the latter, as
more propitious to revolution. They see no merit or demerit
in any man or action or political principle unless he or it
advances or holds back their design for change; so at one
time they take up the most violent and stretched prerogative,
and at another time the wildest democratic ideas of freedom,
passing from one to the other with no regard for cause,
person, or party.

In France you are now in the crisis of a revolution and
in the transit from one form of government to another;
you cannot see that character of men exactly as we see
it in this country. With us it is militant; with you it is
triumphant; and you know how it can act when its power
measures up to its will. Don’t think that I conﬁne these
observations to any description of men or to apply them to

all men of any description. I am as incapable of that injustice
as I am of keeping on good terms with those who profess
principles of extremities and who, in the name of ‘religion’,
teach little except wild and dangerous politics. The worst
thing about the politics of revolution is that it tempers and
harden the breast so as to prepare it for the desperate strokes
that are sometimes used in extreme occasions. But these
occasions may never arrive, so the mind needlessly receives
a taint; and the moral sentiments suffer considerably when
no political purpose is served by the tainting. People of
this sort are so taken up with their theories about man’s
rights that they have totally forgotten his nature. Without
opening any new avenue to the understanding, they have
succeeded in blocking those that lead to the heart. They have
perverted in themselves and in those who listen to them all
the well-placed sympathies of the human breast.

Back to Price

This famous sermon of the Old Jewry breathes nothing but
this spirit through all the political part. Plots, massacres,
assassinations seem to some people a trivial price for obtain-
ing a revolution. Cheap, bloodless reformation, and guiltless
liberty, are ﬂat and vapid to their taste. There must be •a
great change of scene, •a magniﬁcent stage effect, •a grand
spectacle to rouse the imagination grown slack with the lazy
enjoyment of sixty years’ security and the still un-animating
repose of public prosperity. The preacher found all these
in the French Revolution, which inspires a juvenile warmth
through his whole frame [Price was 66 when he wrote the sermon].
His enthusiasm kindles as he advances; and when he arrives
at his peroration it is in a full blaze. Then, viewing from the
mountain-top of his pulpit the free, moral, happy, ﬂourishing
and glorious state of France as in a bird’s-eye landscape of a

36

Reﬂections on the Revolution in France

Edmund Burke

Part 1

promised land, he breaks out into the following rapture:

What an eventful period is this! I am thankful that I
have lived to it; I could almost say, Lord, now lettest
thou thy servant depart in peace, for mine eyes have
seen thy salvation. —I have lived to see a diffusion
of knowledge, which has undermined superstition
and error. —I have lived to see the rights of men
better understood than ever; and nations panting
for liberty that seemed to have lost the idea of it. —I
have lived to see thirty million people, indignant and
resolute, spurning at slavery and demanding liberty
with an irresistible voice. Their king led in triumph
and an arbitrary monarch surrendering himself to his
subjects.

Before going on, I must remark that Dr Price seems to
overvalue the great acquisitions of light that he has obtained
and diffused in this age. The last century appears to me to
have been quite as much ‘enlightened’. It had, though in a
different place, a triumph as memorable as that of Dr Price;
and some of the great preachers of that period partook of it
as eagerly as he has done in the triumph of France. At the
trial of the Rev. Hugh Peters for high treason it was deposed
that when King Charles was brought to London for his trial
the Apostle of Liberty led the triumph. The witness says:
‘I saw his Majesty in the coach with six horses, and Peters
riding before the king, triumphing.’ Dr Price, when he talks
as if he had made a discovery, only follows a precedent, for
after the start of the king’s trial this precursor, the same
Dr Peters, concluding a long prayer at the Royal Chapel at
Whitehall,. . . . said ‘I have prayed and preached these twenty
years; and now I may say with old Simeon “Lord, now lettest
thou thy servant depart in peace, for mine eyes have seen thy
salvation”’. Peters did not get what he prayed for, because
he didn’t depart as soon as he wished, nor did he depart in

peace [He was executed as a regicide]. He became what I heartily
hope none of his followers will be in this country, namely a
sacriﬁce to the triumph that he led as high priest. . . .

After this outburst of the preacher of the Old Jewry, which
differs in place and time but agrees perfectly with the spirit
and letter of the rapture of 1648, the Revolution Society—

•the fabricators of governments,
•the heroic band of dismissers of monarchs,
•electors of sovereigns, and
•leaders of kings in triumph

—strutting with a proud consciousness of the diffusion of
knowledge of which every member had obtained so large a
share, hastened to spread generously the knowledge they
had thus freely received. For this purpose they adjourned
from the church in the Old Jewry to the London Tavern,
where the same Dr Price, in whom the fumes of his oracular
tripod were not entirely evaporated, moved and carried the
resolution or address of congratulation transmitted by Lord
Stanhope to the National Assembly of France.

I ﬁnd a preacher of the gospel •profaning the beautiful
and prophetic exclamation commonly called ‘nunc dimittis’,
made when our Saviour was ﬁrst presented at the Temple,
and •applying it with inhuman and unnatural rapture to
what may be the most horrid, atrocious, and afﬂicting spec-
tacle ever exhibited to the pity and indignation of mankind.
This ‘leading in triumph’ that ﬁlls our preacher with such
unhallowed transports—a thing that at best is unmanly and
irreligious—must shock, I believe, the moral taste of every
well-born mind. Several Englishmen were the stupeﬁed
and indignant spectators of that triumph. Unless we have
been strangely deceived, it was more like •a procession
of American savages, entering into Onondaga after some
of their murders called victories and leading into hovels
hung round with scalps their captives, overpowered with

the scoffs and buffets of women as ferocious as themselves
than like •the triumphal pomp of a civilised nation at war—
if indeed a civilised nation, or any men who had a sense
of generosity, were capable of a personal triumph over the
fallen and afﬂicted.

The conduct of the French National Assembly

This, my dear Sir, was not the triumph of France. I must
believe that you as a nation were overwhelmed with shame
and horror.
I must believe •that the National Assembly
ﬁnd themselves in a state of humiliation because they can’t
punish the authors of this triumph or those who took part
in it, and •that they are in a situation where no inquiry they
can make into this can even seem to be free and impartial.
The assembly’s excuse is found in their situation; but if
we approve what they must bear, it is in us the degenerate
choice of a corrupt mind.

With a compelled appearance of deliberation, they vote
under the dominion of a stern necessity. They meet in
the heart of a foreign republic, as it were: they have their
residence in a city whose constitution didn’t come either from
the charter of their king or from their own legislative power.
There they are surrounded by an army which wasn’t raised
by the authority of their crown or by their command—an
army which, if they ordered its dissolution, would instantly
dissolve them. There they sit, after a gang of assassins
had driven away hundreds of their members, while others,
who held the same moderate principles ·as those who were
driven away·, but held on because they had more patience
or better hope, are daily exposed to outrageous insults
and murderous threats. There a majority (sometimes real,
sometimes pretended) that is itself captive compels a captive
king to issue as royal edicts, at third hand, the polluted

nonsense of their most licentious and giddy coffeehouses. It
is notorious that all their measures are decided before they
are debated. It is beyond doubt that under the terror of the
bayonet and the lamp-post and the torch to their houses they
are obliged to adopt all the crude and desperate measures
suggested by clubs composed of a monstrous jumble of
people of all conditions, tongues, and nations. Among these
are found persons of very low character. And it is not only in
these clubs that public measures are deformed into monsters.
They undergo a previous distortion in academies, intended as
seminaries for these clubs, which are set up in all the places
of public resort. In these meetings every counsel is taken
for the mark of superior genius in proportion as it is daring
and violent and treacherous. Humanity and compassion
are ridiculed as the fruits of superstition and ignorance.
Tenderness to individuals is considered as treason to the
public. Liberty is always to be estimated perfect, as owner-
ship is made insecure. Amidst assassination, massacre, and
conﬁscation—perpetrated or meditated—they are forming
plans for the good order of future society. Embracing in their
arms the carcasses of base criminals and promoting their
relatives on the title of their offences, they force hundreds of
virtuous persons to survive by beggary or by crime.

The Assembly, their organ, presents them with the farce of
deliberation—which is done with as little decency as liberty.
They behave like actors before a riotous audience at a fair;
they act amidst the tumultuous cries of a mixed mob of
ferocious men and of women lost to shame, who. . . .direct,
control, applaud, explode them, and sometimes mix and
take their seats among them, domineering over them with
a strange mixture of •servile petulance and •proud, pre-
sumptuous authority. . . . This assembly, which overthrows
kings and kingdoms, doesn’t even look like a grave legislative
body. . . . Like the evil principle [see Glossary], they have

38

a power to subvert and destroy, but none to construct
anything except machines to create further subversion and
destruction.

The situation of the French king

Who is it that admires national representative assemblies
and from the heart is attached to them and doesn’t turn
with horror and disgust from such a profane burlesque,
and abominable perversion of that sacred institute? Lovers
of monarchy, lovers of republics must alike abhor it. The
members of your assembly must themselves groan under
the tyranny of which they have all the shame, none of the
control, and little of the proﬁt. I am sure that many—even
a majority— of the members of that body must feel as I do,
despite the applause of the Revolution Society. Miserable
king! miserable assembly! How scandalised that assembly
must (silently) be by those of their members who could call a
day that seemed to blot the sun out of heaven ‘un beau jour!’
How indignant they must (inwardly) be at hearing others
who thought ﬁt to declare to them ‘that the vessel of the
state would ﬂy forward in her course toward regeneration
with more speed than ever’, from the stiff gale of treason
and murder that preceded our preacher’s triumph! What
must they have felt when (with outward patience and inward
indignation) they heard it said, regarding the slaughter of in-
nocent gentlemen in their houses, that ‘the blood spilled was
not the most pure’! When they were besieged by complaints
of disorders that shook their country to its foundations,
what must they have felt at being compelled coolly to tell the
complainants that they were under the protection of the law,
and that they would address the king (the captive king) to
cause the laws to be enforced for their protection; doing this
when the enslaved ministers of that captive king had already

formally notiﬁed them that there was no law or authority
or power left to protect? What must they have felt at being
obliged, as a congratulation on the present new year, to
request their captive king to forget the stormy period of the
last year because of the great good he was likely to produce
for his people?. . . .

This address was made with much good nature and
affection, to be sure. But the revolutions in France include
a considerable revolution in their ideas of politeness.
In
England we are said to learn manners at second-hand from
your side of the water, and that we dress our behaviour in
the ornaments of France. If so, we are still in the old fashion
and haven’t adopted the new Parisian mode of good breeding
sufﬁciently to think it a reﬁned and delicate compliment
(whether in condolence or congratulation) to tell the most
humiliated creature that crawls on the earth that great public
beneﬁts are derived from the murder of his servants, the
attempted assassination of himself and of his wife, and
the mortiﬁcation, disgrace, and degradation that he has
personally suffered. Our prison chaplain at Newgate would
be too humane to offer such a ‘consolation’ to a criminal
at the foot of the gallows. I should have thought that the
hangman of Paris, now that he is liberalised by the vote of the
National Assembly and is allowed his rank and arms in the
herald’s college of the rights of men, would be too generous,
too gallant a man, too full of the sense of his new dignity, to
employ that cutting ‘consolation’ to anyone whom ‘treachery
to the nation’ might bring under the administration of his
executive power.

A man is fallen indeed when he is thus ﬂattered. The
anodyne draught of oblivion, thus drugged, is well calculated
to preserve a galling wakefulness and to feed the living ulcer
of a corroding memory. Thus to administer the opiate potion
of amnesty, powdered with all the ingredients of scorn and

39

Part 1

contempt, is to hold to his lips, instead of ‘the balm of hurt
minds’ [a phrase that Shakespeare’s Macbeth applies to sleep], the
cup of human misery full to the brim and to force him to
drink it to the dregs.

Yielding to reasons at least as forcible as those that were
so delicately urged in the compliment on the new year, the
king of France will probably try to forget these events and
that compliment. But history, who keeps a durable record
of all our acts and exercises her awful censure over the
proceedings of all sorts of sovereigns, will not forget either
those events or the era of this liberal reﬁnement in the
intercourse of mankind. History will record that on the
morning of 6 October 1789 the king and queen of France,
after a day of confusion, alarm, dismay, and slaughter, lay
down, under the promised security of public faith, to indulge
nature in a few hours of respite and troubled, melancholy
repose. From this sleep the queen was ﬁrst startled by the
sentinel at her door, who cried out to her to save herself
by ﬂight—that this was the last proof of ﬁdelity he could
give—that they were on him, and he was dead. Instantly
he was cut down. A band of cruel rufﬁans and assassins,
reeking with his blood, rushed into the chamber of the queen
and pierced with a hundred strokes of bayonets and poniards
the bed from which this persecuted woman had barely had
time to ﬂy almost naked, and through ways unknown to the
murderers had escaped to seek refuge at the feet of a king
and husband whose own life was not in the least secure.

This king, and this queen, and their infant children (who
once would have been the pride and hope of a great and
generous people) were then forced to abandon the sanctu-
ary of the most splendid palace in the world, which they
left swimming in blood, polluted by massacre and strewed
with scattered limbs and mutilated carcasses. They were
conducted from there into the capital of their kingdom.

Two had been selected from the unprovoked, unresisted,
promiscuous slaughter that was made of the gentlemen of
birth and family who composed the king’s body guard. These
two gentlemen, with all the parade of an execution of justice,
were cruelly and publicly dragged to the block and beheaded
in the great court of the palace. Their heads were stuck on
spears and led the procession, while the royal captives who
followed in the train procession were slowly moved along,
amid the horrid yells, and shrilling screams, and frantic
dances, and infamous insults, and all the abominations of
the furies of hell in the abused shape of the vilest of women.
After they had been made to taste, drop by drop, more than
the bitterness of death in the slow torture of a journey of
twelve miles dragged out for six hours, they were lodged
in one of the old palaces of Paris, now converted into a
bastille for kings. Their guard there was composed of those
very soldiers who had conducted them through this famous
triumph,

Is this a triumph to be consecrated at altars? to be
commemorated with grateful thanksgiving? to be offered to
the divine humanity with fervent prayer and enthusiastic
exclamation? I assure you that these Theban and Thracian
orgies, enacted in France and applauded only in the Old
Jewry, arouse prophetic enthusiasm in the minds of very few
people in this kingdom, although a saint and apostle. . . [and
then he winds his way into an elaborate sneer at Price].

‘Hang the bishops!’

At ﬁrst I was at a loss to account for this [i.e. Price’s] ﬁt
of unguarded joy.
I knew, indeed, that the sufferings of
monarchs make a delicious meal for some palates. There
were reﬂections that might keep this appetite within some
bounds of temperance. But when I took one fact into account

40

Reﬂections on the Revolution in France

Edmund Burke

Part 1

I had to admit that much allowance ought to be made for
the ·Revolution· Society, and that their temptation was too
strong for common discretion. The fact I am talking about is
that prominent in the people’s triumph was the animating cry
calling ‘for all the bishops to be hanged on the lamp-posts’.
This might well have brought forth a burst of enthusiasm on
the foreseen consequences of this happy day. [This refers to
the fact that Price and others were non-conformists, meaning that they
didn’t accept any form of church government that includes bishops.]. . . .

In the midst of this joy there was (as in all human affairs
there is) something to exercise the patience of these worthy
gentlemen and to try the long-suffering of their faith. The
actual murder of the king and queen, and their child, was
lacking from the other auspicious circumstances of this
‘beautiful day’. The actual murder of the bishops, though
called for by so many holy exclamations, was also lacking.
A picture of regicide and sacrilegious slaughter was indeed
boldly sketched, but it was only sketched.
It was unfor-
tunately left unﬁnished in this great history-piece of the
massacre of innocents. We shall see in due course what
hardy pencil of a great master from the school of the rights of
man will ﬁnish it. The present age has not yet the complete
beneﬁt of that diffusion of knowledge that has undermined
superstition and error [this of course is meant sarcastically]; and
the king of France needs to consign one or two more things to
oblivion, in consideration of all the good that is to arise from
his own sufferings and the patriotic crimes of an enlightened
age. [Burke then devotes a page to quoting (in French) from
a letter in which the Marquis de Lally Tollendal explains to
a friend why, after having played a part in the early stages
of the French Revolution, he eventually left the National
Assembly in horror and disgust.]

The treatment of the French queen

Although this work of our new ‘light and knowledge’ did
not go as far as was probably intended, such treatment of
any human creatures must be shocking to anyone who isn’t
made for accomplishing revolutions. But I cannot stop here.
Inﬂuenced by the inborn feelings of my nature, and not being
illuminated by a single ray of this new-sprung modern ‘light’,
I confess to you, Sir, that

•the exalted rank of the persons suffering, and
particularly
•the sex, the beauty, and the amiable qualities of
·the queen·, the descendant of so many kings and
emperors, along with
•the tender age of the royal infants, protected only by
infancy and innocence from being aware of the cruel
outrages to which their parents were exposed,

instead of being a subject of rejoicing, adds greatly to one’s
sadness regarding that most melancholy occasion.

I hear that the august person who was the principal
object of our preacher’s triumph, ·namely, the king·, though
he supported himself, felt much on that shameful occasion.
As a man, it became him to feel for his wife and his children,
and the faithful personal guards who were massacred in
cold blood around him; as a prince, it was appropriate for
him to feel for the strange and frightful transformation of
his civilised subjects, and to be more grieved for them than
solicitous for himself. This detracts little from his fortitude,
while it adds inﬁnitely to the honour of his humanity. I am
very sorry to say it, very sorry indeed, that such personages
are in a situation in which it is not unbecoming in us to
praise the virtues of the great. [That last sentence is exactly as
Burke wrote it.]

41

Part 1

I hear that the great lady, the other object of the triumph,

has borne that day and that she bears

•all the succeeding days,
•the imprisonment of her husband,
•her own captivity,
•the exile of her friends,
•the insulting mock-respectful way she is addressed,
•the whole weight of her accumulated wrongs

with serene patience, in a manner suited to her rank and
race, and and to her being the offspring of a sovereign [Maria
Theresa, monarch of the Holy Roman Empire] distinguished for her
piety and courage. (I rejoice to hear this, because it is good
that beings made for suffering should suffer well.)
I also
hear that she, like her mother, has lofty sentiments; that
she feels with the dignity of a Roman matron; that in the
last extremity she will save herself from the last disgrace and
that, if she must fall, she will fall by no ignoble hand [meaning
that she will die by her own hand].

It is now sixteen or seventeen years since I saw the
queen of France, then the dauphiness, at Versailles. . . . [He
rapturously sings her praises, and then:] Little did I dream
that she would ever be obliged to carry the sharp antidote
against disgrace concealed in that bosom; little did I dream
that I would live to see such disasters fallen on her in a
nation of gallant men, a nation of men of honour and of
cavaliers. I thought ten thousand swords must have leaped
from their scabbards to avenge even a look that threatened
her with insult. But the age of chivalry is gone.

The age of chivalry is gone

The age of logical tricksters, economists, and calculators has
taken over, and the glory of Europe is extinguished forever.
Never more shall we see that generous loyalty to rank and

sex, that proud submission, that digniﬁed obedience, that
subordination of the heart that kept alive (even in servitude
itself) the spirit of an exalted freedom. The unbought grace of
life,. . . .the nurse of manly sentiment and heroic enterprise,
is gone!
It is gone, that sense of principle, that chastity
of honour that felt a stain like a wound, which inspired
courage while it lessened ferocity, which ennobled whatever
it touched, and under which vice itself lost half its evil by
losing all its grossness.

This mixed system of opinion and sentiment had its origin
in the ancient chivalry; and the principle, though varied
in its appearance by the varying state of human affairs,
has survived and had an inﬂuence through a long series of
generations right through to the present. If it should ever be
totally extinguished, I fear that the loss will be great. This
is what has given modern Europe its character. It is what
has distinguished Europe under all its forms of government,
and distinguished it to its advantage, from the states of Asia
and possibly from the states that ﬂourished in the most
brilliant periods of the antique world. It is what has (without
running the ranks together) produced a noble equality and
handed it down through all the gradations of social life. It
was this opinion that turned kings into companions and
raised private men to be fellows with kings. Without force or
opposition, it subdued the ﬁerceness of pride and power, it
obliged sovereigns to submit to the soft yoke of social esteem,
and compelled stern authority to submit to elegance. . . .

But now all is to be changed. All the pleasing illusions
that made power gentle and obedience liberal, that har-
monised the different shades of life, and by a smooth as-
similation brought into politics the sentiments that beautify
and soften private society, are to be dissolved by this new
conquering empire of ‘light’ and ‘reason’. All the decent
drapery of life is to be roughly torn off. All the super-added

42

Reﬂections on the Revolution in France

Edmund Burke

Part 1

ideas provided by the wardrobe of a moral imagination,
ideas that the heart owns and the understanding ratiﬁes
as necessary to cover the defects of our naked, shivering
nature, and to raise it to dignity in our own estimation,
are to be exploded as a ridiculous, absurd, and antiquated
fashion.

In this scheme of things, a king is only a man, a queen is
only a woman; a woman is only an animal, and not an animal
of the highest order. All homage paid to the female sex in
general. . . .is to be regarded as romance and folly. Regicide,
parricide, and sacrilege are merely ﬁctions of superstition,
corrupting jurisprudence by destroying its simplicity. The
murder of a king, or a queen, or a bishop, or a father are only
common homicide; and if the people happen in some way to
gain from it, it is much the most pardonable sort of homicide,
of which we ought not to make too severe a scrutiny.

On the scheme of this barbarous philosophy—the off-
spring of cold hearts and muddy understandings, and as void
of solid wisdom as it is destitute of all taste and elegance—
laws are to be supported only by their own terrors and by
the concern that each individual may ﬁnd in them from his
own private speculations or can spare to them from his own
private interests. In the groves of their academy, at the end of
every avenue you see nothing but the gallows. Nothing is left
that engages our feelings on behalf of the commonwealth. On
the principles of this mechanic philosophy, our institutions
can never be embodied (so to speak) in persons, so as to
create in us love, veneration, admiration, or attachment.
But the sort of reason that banishes feelings is incapable of
taking their place. These public feelings, combined with man-
ners, are required sometimes as supplements, sometimes as
correctives, always as aids to law. The precept that a wise
man who was also a great critic gave for the construction of
poems is equally true of states: ‘It is not enough that they

be beautiful; they must also be persuasive’ [Burke gives this
in the original Latin of the poet Horace]. Every nation should have
a system of manners that a well-informed mind would be
disposed to enjoy. To make us love our country, our country
ought to be lovely.

But power of one kind or another will survive the shock
in which manners and opinions perish; and it will ﬁnd
other and worse means for its support. The usurpation
that destroyed ancient principles in order to subvert ancient
institutions will •hold power by devices similar to those by
which it has •acquired it. The old feudal and chivalrous spirit
of fealty—·i.e. ﬁdelity and allegiance to one’s lord·—freed
kings from fear and thereby freed both kings and subjects
from the risk of tyranny. When it is extinct in the minds
of men, plots and assassinations will be anticipated by
preventive murder and preventive conﬁscation. . . .

Kings will be tyrants from policy when subjects are rebels

from principle.

The loss of our compass

When ancient opinions and rules of life are taken away, the
loss cannot possibly be estimated. From that moment we
have no compass to govern us; nor can we clearly know what
port we are steering to. On the day on which your revolution
was completed, Europe as a whole was undoubtedly in a
ﬂourishing condition. How much of that prosperous state
was due to the spirit of our old manners and opinions is not
easy to say; but such causes cannot be indifferent [= ‘neither
good nor bad’] in their operation, so we must presume that on
the whole their operation was beneﬁcial.

We are all too apt to consider things in the state in which
we ﬁnd them, without thinking enough about the causes that
have produced them and possibly may uphold them. Nothing

43

Reﬂections on the Revolution in France

Edmund Burke

Part 1

is more certain than that our manners, our civilisation,
and all the good things connected with manners and with
civilisation have in this European world of ours depended
for ages on two principles [see Glossary] and were indeed the
result of the two combined: I mean the spirit of a gentleman
and the spirit of religion. The nobility and the clergy, the
one by patronage, the other by profession, kept learning in
existence even in the midst of arms and confusions and at
times when governments were not yet fully formed. What
learning received from nobility and priesthood it paid back
with interest, by enlarging their ideas and by furnishing
their minds. Happy if they had all continued to know their
indissoluble union and their proper place! Happy if learning,
not depraved by ambition, had been satisﬁed to continue as
the instructor and not aspired to be the master! Along with
its natural protectors and guardians, learning will now be
thrown into the mud and trodden down under the hoofs of a
swinish multitude.

I suspect that modern letters owe to ancient manners
more than they are always willing to admit; and so do
other interests that we value quite as much as they are
worth. Even commerce and trade and manufacture, the
gods of our economic politicians, are themselves perhaps
mere creatures, are themselves merely effects that we choose
to worship as ﬁrst causes. They certainly grew under the
same shade in which learning ﬂourished. They may also
decay with their natural protecting principles. With you ·in
France·, for the present at least, they are all threatening
to disappear together. Where trade and manufactures are
lacking to a people, and the spirit of nobility and religion
remains, sentiment ﬁlls their place, and not always badly;
but if commerce and the arts are lost in an experiment to try

how well a state can stand without these old fundamental
principles ·of nobility and religion·, what sort of a thing must
a nation be if it is composed of gross, stupid, ferocious—and
at the same time poor and sordid—barbarians, destitute
of religion, honour, or manly pride, possessing nothing at
present, and hoping for nothing hereafter?

I hope you are not going fast, and by the shortest cut, to
that horrible and disgusting situation. Already there appears
a poverty of conception, a coarseness, and a vulgarity in all
the proceedings of the Assembly and of all their instructors.
Their liberty is not liberal. Their science is presumptuous
ignorance. Their humanity is savage and brutal.

It is not clear whether we in England learned from you
those grand and decorous principles and manners of which
considerable traces still remain, or whether you took them
from us. But I think it’s more likely that you are the source.
France has always more or less inﬂuenced manners in Eng-
land; and when your fountain is choked up and polluted, the
stream will not run long or clear, with us or perhaps with any
nation. This, in my opinion, gives all Europe a concern—an
all too close and connected one—with what is done in France.
So please excuse me if I have dwelt too long on the atrocious
spectacle of the 6 October 1789 [when the revolutionaries brought
the royal family to Paris from Versailles], or have given too much
scope to the reﬂections that have arisen in my mind on
occasion of the most important of all revolutions, which may
be dated from that day—I mean a revolution in sentiments,
manners, and moral opinions. As things now stand, with
everything respectable destroyed outside us and an attempt
to destroy every principle of respect within us, one is almost
forced to apologise for having common human feelings.

Corrupt head versus natural heart

Why do I feel so differently from the Reverend Dr Price and
those of his lay ﬂock who will choose to adopt the sentiments
of his discourse? For this plain reason: •because it is natural
I should; •because we are so made as to be affected at
such spectacles with melancholy sentiments regarding the
unstable condition of mortal prosperity and the tremendous
uncertainty of human greatness; •because in those natural
feelings we learn great lessons; •because in events like these
our passions instruct our reason; •because when kings are
hurled from their thrones by the Supreme Director of this
great drama and become the objects of insult to the base and
of pity to the good, we behold disasters in the moral order
of things like beholding a miracle in the physical order. We
are alarmed into reﬂection; our minds (as it has long since
been observed) are puriﬁed by terror and pity, our weak,
unthinking pride is humbled under the dispensations of a
mysterious wisdom. Some tears might be drawn from me
if such a spectacle were exhibited on the stage. I would be
truly ashamed of ﬁnding in myself that superﬁcial, theatrical
sense of painted distress if I could rejoice over it in real
life. With such a perverted mind I could never venture to
show my face at a ·theatrical· tragedy. People would think
the tears that ﬁne actors have extorted from me were the
tears of hypocrisy; I would know them to be the tears of folly.
[He means: if he accepted what he takes to be the French revolutionaries’
thoughts and feelings about human distress he would think it was simply
stupid to weep at distress shown on the stage.]

Indeed, the theatre is a better school of moral sentiments
than churches, where the feelings of humanity are thus

outraged. Poets who have to deal with an audience not
yet graduated from the school of the ‘rights of men’ and
who must apply themselves to the moral constitution of the
heart would not dare to produce such a ‘triumph’ ·as that of
6.x.1789· as a matter for rejoicing. In the theatre, where men
follow their natural impulses, they would not bear the odious
maxims of a Machiavellian policy, whether applied to the
achievement of monarchic tyranny or democratic tyranny.
They would reject them on the modern stage as they once
did on the ancient one, where they could not bear even
the hypothetical proposal of such wickedness in the mouth
of someone acting a tyrant, even if it was suitable to the
character he was portraying. No theatrical audience in
Athens would bear what has been borne in the midst of the
real tragedy of this triumphal day: a principal actor weighing
(as it were) in scales hung in a shop of horrors so much
actual crime against so much resultant advantage and, after
putting in and out weights, declaring that the balance was
on the side of the advantages. They would not bear to see
the crimes of new democracy posted as in a ledger against
the crimes of old despotism, and the book-keepers of politics
ﬁnding democracy still in debt but by no means unable or
unwilling to pay the balance. In the theatre the ﬁrst intuitive
glance, without any elaborate process of reasoning, will show
that this method of political computation would justify every
extent of crime. They would see that on these principles,
even where the very worst acts were not perpetrated, this
was because of the fortune of the conspirators rather than
because of their parsimony in the expenditure of treachery
and blood. They would soon see that criminal methods once
•tolerated are soon •preferred. They present a short cut to

45

Reﬂections on the Revolution in France

Edmund Burke

Part 2

the objective instead of a longer route through the highway
of the moral virtues. Justifying treachery and murder for
public beneﬁt, public beneﬁt would soon become the excuse
and treachery and murder the end, until rapacity, malice,
revenge, and fear more dreadful than revenge could satiate
their insatiable appetites. Such must be the consequences
of losing, in the splendour of these triumphs of the ‘rights of
men’, all natural sense of wrong and right.

‘An arbitrary monarch’

But the reverend pastor rejoices in this ‘leading in triumph’,
because truly Louis XVI was ‘an arbitrary monarch’; which
means neither more nor less than because he was Louis XVI
and because he had the misfortune to be born king of France,
with the prerogatives that had been put in his possession
by a long line of ancestors and a long acquiescence of the
people, without any act of his. It has indeed turned out to
be a misfortune it for him that he was born king of France.
But misfortune is not crime, nor is indiscretion always the
greatest guilt. I shall never think that a prince

whose whole reign involved a series of concessions to
his subjects, who was willing to relax his authority,
to remit his prerogatives, to call his people to a share
of freedom that their ancestors had not known and
perhaps had not desired,

that such a prince,

even if he had the common frailties attached to
men and to princes, and even if he once thought
it necessary to provide force against the desperate
designs obviously launched against his person and
the remnants of his authority

—though all this should be taken into consideration—I can-
not think that such a prince deserves the cruel and insulting

triumph of Paris and of Dr Price. I tremble for the cause of
liberty when such an example is given to kings. I tremble
for the cause of humanity in the unpunished outrages of
the most wicked of mankind. But there are some people
whose way of thinking is so low and degenerate that they
look up with a sort of complacent awe and admiration to
kings who know to keep ﬁrm in their seat, to hold a strict
hand over their subjects, to assert their prerogative, and
by the awakened vigilance of a severe despotism to guard
against the very ﬁrst approaches to freedom. They never raise
their voice against such as these. Deserters from principle,
enlisted with fortune, they never see any good in suffering
virtue or any crime in prosperous usurpation.

If it could have been made clear to me that the king
and queen of France (I mean those who were king and
queen before the triumph) were inexorable and cruel tyrants,
that they had formed a deliberate scheme for massacring
the National Assembly (I think I have seen something like
that insinuated in certain publications), I would think their
captivity just. If this were true, much more ought to have
been done, though in my opinion done in another manner.
The punishment of real tyrants is a noble and awe-inspiring
act of justice; and it has truly been said to be consolatory to
the human mind. But if I were to punish a wicked king, I
would have a concern for the dignity with which the crime
was avenged. Justice is grave and decorous, and in its
punishment seems to •submit to a necessity rather than
to •make a choice. Had Nero, or Agrippina, or Louis XI, or
Charles IX been the subject; if Charles XII of Sweden after
the murder of Patkul, or his predecessor Christina after the
murder of Monaldeschi had fallen into your hands, Sir, or
into mine, I am sure our conduct would have been different.
If the French king, or king of the French (or whatever he
is called in the new vocabulary of your constitution), has

46

Part 2

in his own person and that of his queen really deserved
these. . . .murderous attempts and those frequent indignities
more cruel than murder, such a person would not deserve
even the ‘subordinate executive trust’ that I understand is
to be placed in him, nor is he ﬁt to be called chief in a
nation that he has outraged and oppressed. A worse choice
for such an ofﬁce in a new commonwealth than that of a
deposed tyrant could not possibly be made. But to degrade
and insult a man as the worst of criminals and afterwards
to trust him in your highest concerns as a faithful, honest,
and zealous servant is not consistent in reasoning, prudent
in policy, or safe in practice. Those who could make such
an appointment must be guilty of a more ﬂagrant breach of
trust than any they have yet committed against the people.
As this is the only crime in which your leading politicians
could have acted inconsistently, I conclude that there is no
basis for these horrid insinuations ·against the king·. . . .

Speaking on behalf of England

In England we give no credit to them. We are generous
enemies; we are faithful allies. We kick away with disgust
and indignation the slanders of those who bring us their
anecdotes with the conﬁrmation of the ﬂeur-de-lys on their
shoulder. We have Lord George Gordon locked up in Newgate;
and neither his being a public proselytiser to Judaism, nor
his having in his zeal against Catholic priests and all sorts of
ecclesiastics raised a mob that pulled down all our prisons,
have preserved for him a liberty that he did not make himself
worthy of by using it virtuously. . . . We have prisons almost
as strong as the Bastille for those who dare to libel the queens
of France.
In this spiritual retreat, let the noble libeller
remain. Let him there meditate on his Talmud until he learns
a conduct more suitable to his birth and abilities, and not so

disgraceful to the ancient religion for which he has become
a proselytiser; or until some persons from your side of the
water, to please your new Hebrew brethren, shall ransom
him.
[Burke now embarks on a complex joke about the
compound interest over 1790 years on thirty pieces of silver.
Then:] Send us your Popish archbishop of Paris, and we will
send you our Protestant Rabbin [meaning Lord George Gordon].
We shall treat the person you send us like a gentleman and
an honest man, as he is; but please let him bring with him
the fund of his hospitality, bounty, and charity, and we
shall never conﬁscate a shilling of that honourable and pious
fund, nor think of enriching the treasury with the spoils of
the poor-box.

To tell you the truth, my dear Sir, I think the honour
of our nation is somewhat concerned in disclaiming the
proceedings of this society of the Old Jewry and the London
Tavern. I have not been appointed to speak. I speak only for
myself when I disclaim, as I do with all possible earnestness,
all connection with those who took part in that triumph or
with those who admire it. When I assert anything regarding
the people of England I speak from observation, not from au-
thority, but I speak from the experience I have had in a pretty
extensive and mixed communication with the inhabitants of
this kingdom, of all descriptions and ranks, and after a series
of attentive observations begun early in life and continued
for nearly forty years [he was 61 when he wrote this]. Considering
that we are divided from you only by a slender dyke of about
twenty-four miles, and that the two-way contact between
the two countries has recently been very great, I have often
been astonished to ﬁnd how little you seem to know of us.
I suspect that this is because you form a judgment of this
nation from certain publications that represent the opinions
and dispositions generally prevalent in England either very
erroneously or not at all. The vanity, restlessness, petulance,

47

Reﬂections on the Revolution in France

Edmund Burke

Part 2

and spirit of intrigue of several little cabals [see Glossary] who
try to hide their total unimportance in bustle and noise,
pufﬁng, and mutual quotation of each other, makes you
think that our contemptuous neglect of their abilities is a
mark of general acceptance of their opinions. No such thing,
I assure you. Because half a dozen grasshoppers under a
fern make the ﬁeld ring with their importunate chink!, while
thousands of cattle lying beneath the shadow of the British
oak chew the cud and are silent, don’t think that those
who make the noise are •the only inhabitants of the ﬁeld,
are •very numerous, or indeed are •anything but the little,
shrivelled, meagre, hopping, though loud and troublesome,
insects of the hour!

I almost venture to afﬁrm that not one in a hundred
among us shares in the ‘triumph’ of the Revolution Society.
If the king and queen of France, and their children, were
to fall into our hands by the chance of war, in the most
acrimonious of all hostilities (I deplore such an event, I
deplore such hostility), they would be treated with another
sort of triumphal entry into London. We have had a king
of France in that situation [John II, after the battle of Poitiers
in 1356]; you have read how he was treated by the victor
in the ﬁeld, and how he was then received in England.
Four hundred years have passed but I believe we are not
signiﬁcantly changed since that period. Thanks to our sullen
resistance to innovation, thanks to the cold sluggishness
of our national character, we still bear the stamp of our
forefathers. We have not (I think) lost the generosity and
dignity of thinking of the 14th century, nor as yet have we
subtilised [here = ‘reﬁned’] ourselves into savages. We are not
the converts of Rousseau; we are not the disciples of Voltaire;
Helvetius has made no progress among us. Atheists are not
our preachers; madmen are not our lawgivers. We know that
we have made no discoveries in morality, and we think that

no discoveries are to be made there, nor many in the great
principles of government or in the ideas of liberty, which were
understood long before we were born quite as well as they
will be after. . . .·our death·. In England our natural entrails
have not yet been completely ripped out; we still feel within
us, and we cherish and cultivate, those inbred sentiments
that are the faithful guardians and active monitors of our
duty, the true supporters of all liberal and manly morals. We
have not been disemboweled and tied up so as to be ﬁlled,
like stuffed birds in a museum, with chaff and rags and
paltry blurred shreds of paper about the rights of men. We
preserve the whole of our feelings still native and entire, not
made tricky by pedantry and inﬁdelity. We have real hearts
of ﬂesh and blood beating in our bosoms. We fear God; we
look up with awe to kings, with affection to parliaments,
with duty to magistrates, with reverence to priests, and with
respect to nobility. Why? Because when such ideas are
brought before our minds it is natural to have such feelings;
because all other feelings are false and spurious and tend to
corrupt our minds, to vitiate our primary morals, to make
us unﬁt for rational liberty, and, by teaching us a servile,
licentious, and abandoned insolence, to be our low sport
for a few holidays, to make us perfectly ﬁt for, and justly
deserving of, slavery through the whole course of our lives.

In defence of prejudices

You see, Sir, that in this ‘enlightened’ age I am bold enough
to confess that we are generally men of untaught feelings,
that instead of throwing away all our old prejudices [see
Glossary] we cherish them to a very considerable degree,
and—to increase our shame!—we cherish them because they
are prejudices; and the longer they have lasted and the
more widespread they have been, the more we cherish them.

48

Part 2

We are afraid to have men try to to live and trade each
on his own private stock of reason, because we suspect
that this stock in each man is small, and that individuals
would do better to avail themselves of the general bank
and capital of nations and of ages. Many of our thinkers,
instead of exploding general prejudices, use their skill to
discover the wisdom that lies hidden in them. If they ﬁnd
what they seek (which they usually do), they think it wiser
to continue the prejudice with the reason nested in it than
to throw away the coat of prejudice and to leave nothing
but the naked reason; because prejudice, with its reason,
has a motive to give action to that reason and a feeling that
will give it permanence. Prejudice is ready for application
in an emergency; it has the mind already engaged in a
steady course of wisdom and virtue, and doesn’t leave the
man hesitating—sceptical, puzzled, and unresolved—at the
moment of decision. Prejudice makes a man’s virtue his
habit, and not a series of unconnected acts. Through just
prejudice his duty becomes a part of his nature.

Your literary men and your politicians essentially differ
in these points, and so do the whole clan of the ‘enlightened’
among us. They have no respect for the wisdom of others,
but they pay it off by a very full measure of conﬁdence in their
own. A scheme of things being old is, for them, a sufﬁcient
motive to destroy it. As for the new, they have no fears about
the duration of a building put up in haste, because duration
is not a goal for those who think that little or nothing has
been done before their time, and who place all their hopes in
discovery. They conceive, very systematically, that all things
that provide permanence are harmful, so they are at war—a
war that can’t be settled—with all establishments. They think
that government can vary like fashions in dress, and with as
little bad effect; that all we need to attach ourselves to any
constitution of the state is a sense of present convenience.

They always speak as if they thought that there is a singular
species of contract between them and their magistrates that
binds the magistrate but has nothing reciprocal in it—the
majesty of the people has a right to dissolve the government
without any reason but its will. Their attachment to their
country itself is conditional on its agreeing with some of their
ﬂeeting projects; it begins and ends with the political scheme
that squares with their momentary opinion.

These doctrines, or rather these sentiments, seem preva-
lent with your new statesmen. But they are wholly different
from the ones we have always acted on in this country.

If anyone tried to push England France’s way. . .

I hear that it is sometimes said in France that what is going
on among you follows the example of England. I beg leave
to afﬁrm that hardly anything done with you has originated
from the practice or the prevalent opinions of this people,
either •what you are doing or •the spirit in which you are
doing it. Let me add that we are as unwilling to learn
these lessons from France as we are sure that we never
taught them to that nation. The cabals here who take
a sort of share of your transactions still contain only a
handful of people. If by their intrigues, their sermons, their
publications, and by a conﬁdence derived from an expected
union with the counsels and forces of the French nation,
they draw considerable numbers into their faction and then
seriously attempt anything here in imitation of what has
been done in France, I dare venture to prophesy that the
outcome—causing some trouble to their country along the
way—will be their own early destruction. The English people
long ago refused to change their law out of respect for the
infallibility of popes, and they will not now alter it from a
pious implicit faith in the dogmatism of philosophers, though

49

Reﬂections on the Revolution in France

Edmund Burke

Part 2

the pope was armed with the anathema and crusade, and
though the philosophers should act with pamphlets and
lamp-posts [see note on page 29].

Formerly, your affairs were your own concern only. We
felt for them as •men, but we kept apart from them because
we were not citizens of France. But when we see the model
held up to ourselves, we must feel as •Englishmen, and
feeling in that way we must behave as Englishmen. We
did not want this, but our own interests now involve your
affairs, at least in having us keep your panacea or plague at
a distance. If it is a panacea, we do not want it. We know
the results of taking unnecessary medicines. If it is a plague,
it is of such a kind that the most severe quarantine ought to
be established against it.

I hear on all hands that a cabal [see Glossary] calling
itself ‘philosophic’ receives the glory of many of the recent
proceedings, and that their opinions and systems are the
true actuating spirit of the whole of them. I have heard of
no literary or political party in England known by such a
description.
Is yours composed of men whom the vulgar
in their blunt, homely style commonly call ‘atheists’ and
‘inﬁdels’? If so, I admit that we too have had writers of
that description who made some noise in their day. At
present they repose in lasting oblivion. Who, born within
the last forty years, has read one word of Collins, Toland,
Tindal, Chubb, or Morgan, or that whole race who called
themselves ‘freethinkers’? Who now reads Bolingbroke? Who
ever read him through? Ask the booksellers of London what
is become of all these lights of the world! In as few years
their few successors will also be buried and forgotten. But
whatever they were or are, with us they were and are wholly
unconnected individuals—they were not gregarious. They
never acted as a body or were known as a faction in the state,
or presumed under the label ‘Freethinkers’ to inﬂuence any

of our public concerns. Whether they ought so to exist
and be permitted so to act is another question. Because
such cabals have not existed in England, the cabal spirit
had never had any inﬂuence in establishing the original
structure of our constitution or in any of the various repairs
and improvements it has undergone. The whole thing has
been done under the auspices of religion and piety, and is
conﬁrmed by their sanctions.
It has emanated from the
simplicity of our national character and from a sort of native
plainness and directness of understanding, which for a long
time characterised the men who have successively obtained
authority among us. This disposition still remains, at least
in the great body of the people.

Religion as the basis of civil society

We know—and, what is better, we feel inwardly—that religion
is the basis of civil society and the source of all good and of
all comfort. In England we are so convinced of this that there
is no rust of superstition that the accumulated absurdity
of the human mind might have crusted religion over with
in the course of ages, that ninety-nine in a hundred of the
people of England wouldn’t prefer to impiety. We shall never
be such fools as to call on an enemy to the substance of
any system to remove its corruptions, to ﬁll its gaps, or to
complete its construction. If our religious tenets ever need
further elucidation, we shall not call on atheism to explain
them. . . . Violently condemning neither the Greek nor the
Armenian nor (since heats have subsided) the Roman system
of religion, we prefer the Protestant, not because we think it
has less of the Christian religion in it but because we think
it has more. We are Protestants not from indifference but
from zeal.

We know, and are proud to know, that man is by his

50

Reﬂections on the Revolution in France

Edmund Burke

Part 2

constitution a religious animal; that atheism is against not
only our reason but our instincts; and that it cannot prevail
long. But if, in the moment of riot and in a drunken delirium
from the hot spirit drawn out of the alembic of hell that is
now so furiously boiling in France we should uncover our
nakedness by throwing off the Christian religion that has
hitherto been our boast and comfort, and one great source
of civilisation among us and among many other nations, we
fear (being well aware that the mind will not endure a void)
that some uncouth, pernicious, and degrading superstition
might take its place.

For that reason we don’t want to deprive our establish-
ment of the natural, human means of estimation and give it
up to contempt, as you have done and thereby incurred the
penalties you deserve to suffer, until we are shown something
to put in its place. Then we shall form our judgment.

On the basis of these ideas, instead of quarrelling with
establishments, as some do who have made a philosophy
and a religion of their hostility to such institutions, we cling
to them. We are resolved to keep an established •church, an
established •monarchy, an established •aristocracy, and an
established •democracy, each in the degree it exists, and in
no greater. I shall show you presently how much of each of
these we possess. [On page 90 Burke announces a change of mind:
he won’t deal with three of those four in this ‘letter’.]

It has been the misfortune (not, as these gentlemen think,
the glory) of this age that everything is to be discussed as if
the constitution of our country were to be always a subject
of arguments rather than enjoyment. For this reason, as
well as for the satisfaction of those among you (if there are
any such among you) who may wish to proﬁt from examples,
I venture to trouble you with a few thoughts about each of
these establishments. I do not think they were unwise in
ancient Rome, when they wished to new-model their laws, to

set commissioners to examine the best constituted republics
within their reach.

An established church

First, let me speak of our church establishment, which is
the ﬁrst of our prejudices, not a prejudice destitute of reason
but containing profound and extensive wisdom. It is ﬁrst
and last and midst in our minds. For, taking ground on the
religious system that we now have, we continue to act on the
early-received and uniformly-continued sense of mankind.
That sense has not only (like a wise architect) •built up the
imposing structure of states, but—wanting like a provident
proprietor to preserve the structure from profanation and
ruin, as a sacred temple purged from all the impurities of
fraud and violence and injustice and tyranny—has •solemnly
and forever consecrated the commonwealth and all who
ofﬁciate in it. This consecration is made so that all who
administer the government of men, in which they stand in
for God himself, should have high and worthy notions of
their function and destination, that their hope should be full
of immortality, that they should not look to the trivial gains
of the moment or to the temporary and transient praise of the
vulgar, but to a solid, permanent existence in the permanent
part of their nature, and to a permanent fame and glory in
the example they leave as a rich inheritance to the world.

Such high principles ought to be infused into persons in
high places, and religious establishments should be provided
that may continually revive and enforce them. Every sort
of moral, every sort of civil, every sort of politic institution,
aiding the rational and natural ties that connect the human
understanding and affections to the divine, are needed to
build up that wonderful structure Man, whose prerogative
it is to be to a large extent a creature of his own making,

51

Reﬂections on the Revolution in France

Edmund Burke

Part 2

and who (when made as he ought to be made) is destined to
occupy a signiﬁcant place in the creation. But whenever a
man is put over men. . . ., it is especially important that he
should be as near as possible to his perfection [here = ‘to being
completely ﬁnished’].

The consecration of the state by a state religious es-
tablishment is needed also to produce a wholesome awe
in free citizens. To secure their freedom, they must have
some determinate portion of power; so •for them a religion
connected with the state and with their duty toward it
becomes even more necessary than •for societies where
the people are conﬁned by the terms of their subjection to
private sentiments and the management of their own family
concerns. All persons having any power ought to be strongly
impressed with the awesome idea that they act in trust, and
that they will have to account for their conduct in that trust
to the one great Master, Author, and Founder of society.

This principle ought to be even more strongly im-
pressed on the minds of •those who compose the collective
sovereignty than on the minds of •single princes. Without
instruments, these princes can do nothing. Whoever uses
instruments in ﬁnding helps also ﬁnds difﬁculties. So
their power is far from complete, and they are not safe
from extreme abuse. However elevated they are by ﬂattery,
arrogance, and self-opinion, princes must be aware that they
are. . . .in some way or other accountable even here—·and
not only before God on the day of judgment·—for any abuse
of their trust. If they are not cut off by a rebellion of their
people, they may be strangled by the very guards kept for
their security against all other rebellion. Thus we have seen
the king of France sold by his soldiers for an increase of pay.
But where popular [see Glossary] authority is absolute and
unrestrained, the people’s conﬁdence in their own power is
inﬁnitely greater because far better founded. To a consider-

able extent they are themselves their own instruments. They
are nearer to their objects. Besides, they are less answerable
to one of the greatest controlling powers on earth, namely
the sense of fame and admiration. The share of infamy
that comes to each individual in public acts is likely to be
small indeed, because the operation of opinion is inversely
proportional to the number of those who abuse power. Their
own approval of their own acts appears to them as a public
judgment in their favour. A perfect democracy is therefore
the most shameless thing in the world—and also the most
fearless: no man has a sense that he personally can be
subjected to punishment. Certainly the people at large never
ought to be, because all punishments are meant as examples,
aimed at protecting the people at large; so the people at large
can never become the subject of punishment by any human
hand. It is therefore inﬁnitely important that they should
not be allowed to think that their will is the standard of right
and wrong, any more than a king’s is. They ought to be
convinced that

•they are no more entitled ·than a king is· to use any
arbitrary power whatsoever, and that they are much less
qualiﬁed than a king is to use arbitrary power in a way that
doesn’t threaten their own safety; and that therefore

•they are not (under a false show of liberty) to exercise an
unnatural, inverted domination, tyrannically exacting from
those who ofﬁciate in the state not an entire devotion to their
interest (which is their right) but an abject submission to
their passing whims, extinguishing in those who serve them
all moral principle, all sense of dignity, all use of judgment,
and all consistency of character; while by the very same
process they turn themselves into a proper, a suitable, but
a most contemptible prey to the servile ambition of popular
rabble-rousers or courtly ﬂatterers.

52

Caution in amending the state

When the people have emptied themselves of all the cravings
of selﬁsh will (which without religion they can’t possibly do),
when they are conscious that they exercise. . . .the power
that can’t be legitimate unless it squares with the eternal,
immutable law in which will and reason are the same, they
will be more careful about putting power into base and
incompetent hands. In picking people to exercise authority,
they won’t treat this as though it were appoint them to a
pitiful job [see Glossary], but as to a holy function. They won’t
select according to their sordid, selﬁsh interest, or to their
wild whims, or to their arbitrary will; rather, they will confer
that power (which any man may well tremble to give or to
receive) only on those in whom they can see that predomi-
nant proportion of active virtue and wisdom. . . .that can be
found in the great mixed mass of human imperfections and
inﬁrmities.

When they are habitually convinced that to someone
whose essence is good it is unacceptable to do evil or to per-
mit it, they will be better able to sweep out of the minds of all
magistrates—civil, ecclesiastical, or military—anything that
has the least resemblance to proud and lawless domination.
But one of the ﬁrst and most leading principles on which
the commonwealth and the laws are consecrated is that
power-holders. . . .should not have a right to cut off the entail
[i.e. to block the inheriting of property] or commit waste on the
inheritance by choosing to destroy the whole original fabric of
their society, risking leaving a ruin instead of a habitation to
those who come after them—and teaching these successors
to respect their contrivances as little as they had respected
the institutions of their forefathers. By this unprincipled
readiness to change the state as often, as much, and as
variously as there are ﬂoating fancies or fashions, the whole

chain and continuity of the commonwealth would be broken.
No one generation could link with the next. Men would
become little better than the ﬂies of a summer.

And ﬁrst of all, the science of jurisprudence would be
regarded as a heap of old exploded errors, and would be no
longer studied. (Actually, it is the pride of the human intel-
lect, which—with all its defects, redundancies, and errors—is
the collected reason of ages, combining the principles of
original justice with the inﬁnite variety of human concerns.)
Personal self-sufﬁciency and arrogance, which are always
found in those who have never experienced a wisdom greater
than their own, would usurp the tribunal. No certain laws
establishing invariable grounds of hope and fear would keep
men’s actions on a certain course or direct them to a certain
goal. Nothing stable in the ways of holding property or
exercising functions could form a solid basis on which any
parent could think through the education of his offspring
or a choice for their future establishment in the world. No
principles would be early worked into people’s habits. As
soon as the most able instructor had completed his laborious
work, instead of sending forth his pupil, accomplished in
a virtuous discipline and ﬁtted to get attention and respect
for him in his place in society, he would ﬁnd that he had
turned out a poor creature to the contempt and derision
of a world that was ignorant of the true grounds of esteem.
Who could ensure that a tender and delicate sense of honour
would beat almost with the ﬁrst pulses of the heart, when
no man could know what would be the test of honour in
a nation continually varying the standard of its coin? No
part of life would retain its acquisitions. Barbarism with
regard to science and literature, unskilfulness with regard
to arts and manufactures, would inevitably follow the lack of
a steady education and settled principle; and thus in a few
generations the commonwealth itself would crumble away,

53

Reﬂections on the Revolution in France

Edmund Burke

Part 2

be broken up into the dust and powder of individuality, and
at length dispersed to all the winds of heaven.

The evils of inconstancy and changeability are ten thou-
sand times worse than those of obstinacy and the blindest
prejudice. To avoid them, therefore, we have consecrated
the state, so that no man should come close to look into
its defects or corruptions except with due caution, that he
should never dream of starting to reform it by subverting
it, that he should come to the faults of the state as to the
wounds of a father, with pious awe and trembling solicitude.
By this wise prejudice we are taught to look with horror
on those children of their country who are prompt rashly to
hack that aged parent in pieces and put him into the kettle of
magicians, in hopes that by their poisonous weeds and wild
incantations they may regenerate the paternal constitution
and renovate their father’s life.

Society as a contract

Society is indeed a contract. Subordinate contracts for
objects of mere occasional interest may be dissolved at
pleasure; but the state ought not to be considered as nothing
better than a partnership agreement in a trade of pepper
and coffee, calico, or tobacco, or some other such low
concern, to be taken up for a little temporary interest and
dissolved at the wish of the parties. It is to be looked on
with reverence, because it is not a partnership in temporary
and perishable things that are subservient only to our gross
animal existence. It is a partnership in

•all science,
•all art,
•every virtue, and
•all perfection.

The goals of such a partnership can be obtained only over
many generations, so it becomes a partnership not only
making connections among those who are living, but one
connecting those who are living with those who are dead
and those who are not yet born. Each contract of each
particular state is only a clause in the great primeval contract
of eternal society, linking the lower with the higher natures,
connecting the visible with the invisible world, according
to a ﬁxed contract sanctioned by the inviolable oath that
holds all physical and moral natures in their appointed
places. This law is not subject to the will of those who—by an
obligation inﬁnitely superior to them—are bound to submit
their will to that law. The municipal corporations of that
universal kingdom are not morally free, at their pleasure
and on their theories about a contingent improvement, to
tear apart the bands of their subordinate community and to
dissolve it into an unsocial, uncivil, unconnected chaos of
elementary principles. The only thing that can justify a resort
to anarchy is the ﬁrst and supreme necessity, a necessity
that is not chosen but chooses, a necessity that is paramount
to deliberation, admitting no discussion and demanding no
evidence. This necessity is no exception to the rule, because
this necessity is itself also a part of the moral and physical
disposition of things to which man must be obedient by
consent or force; but if something that is only submission
to necessity is made the object of choice, the law is broken,
nature is disobeyed, and the rebellious are outlawed, cast
out and exiled from this world of reason, order, peace, virtue,
and fruitful penitence into the antagonist world of madness,
discord, vice, confusion, and unavailing sorrow.

These, my dear Sir, are, were, and (I think) long will be
the sentiments of people who are not the least learned and
reﬂective part of this kingdom. They form their opinions on
such grounds as such persons ought to form them. Less

54

inquiring people receive the opinions from an authority which
those whom Providence dooms to live on trust need not be
ashamed to rely on. These two sorts of men move in the
same direction, though in a different place. They both move
with the order of the universe.

They all know or feel this great ancient truth:

‘To the great and all-powerful God who rules this
entire universe, nothing is more pleasing than the
unions and gatherings of men bound together by laws
that are called states.’ [Burke gives it in Cicero’s Latin]

They take this tenet of the head and heart not from the
great name which it immediately bears, nor from the greater
from which it is derived, but from the only thing that can
give true weight and sanction to any learned opinion, the
common nature and common relation of men. . . . They
see themselves as bound to perform their national homage
to the institutor and author and protector of civil society;
without which civil society man could not possibly arrive
at the perfection his nature is capable of, or even make a
remote and faint approach to it. They conceive that He who
gave our nature to be perfected by our virtue willed also the
necessary means of its perfection. So He willed the state—He
willed its connection with the source and original archetype
of all perfection. They who are convinced of this His will,
which is the law of laws and the sovereign of sovereigns,
cannot think it wrong that our ·praise of the state· should
be performed as all solemn public acts are performed, in
buildings, in music, in decoration, in speech, in the dignity
of persons, according to the customs taught to mankind by
their nature; that is, with modest splendour and unassuming
state, with mild majesty and sober pomp.
[In that sentence
‘praise of the state’ replaces a very ﬂowery two-line noun phrase.] For
those purposes they think some part of the wealth of the
country is as usefully employed as it can be in promoting

the luxury of individuals. It is the public ornament. It is the
public consolation. It nourishes the public hope. The poorest
man ﬁnds his own importance and dignity in it, whereas the
wealth and pride of individuals at every moment makes the
man of humble rank and fortune aware of his low position
and drags it even lower. It is to help the man in humble life,
and to raise his nature and to put him in mind of a state
in which the privileges of wealth will cease, when he will be
equal by nature and may be more than equal by virtue, that
this portion of the general wealth of his country is employed
and sanctiﬁed.

I assure you I am not aiming at originality here. I give you
opinions that have been accepted among us continuously
from very early times until today, and that are ·so thor-
oughly· worked into my mind that I am unable to distinguish
what I have learned from others from the results of my own
meditation.

English attitudes

It is on some such principles that the majority of the people of
England, far from thinking a national religious establishment
unlawful, hardly think it lawful not to have one. If you in
France do not believe that we are attached to this above all
other things and beyond all other nations, you are wholly
mistaken; and when this people has acted unwisely and
unjustiﬁably in its favour (as sometimes they most certainly
have done), their very errors will at least show to you their
zeal.

This principle runs through their whole political structure.
They consider their church establishment not as ·merely·
•convenient but as •essential to their state—not as something
heterogeneous and separable, an add-on that they may
keep or lay aside according to their temporary ideas of

55

Part 2

convenience. They regard it as the foundation of their whole
constitution, with which (and with every part of which) it is
indissolubly united. Church and state are ideas inseparable
in their minds, and scarcely is the one ever mentioned
without mentioning the other.

Our education is formed in a way that conﬁrms and
ﬁxes this impression. Our education is in a way wholly
in the hands of ecclesiastics, at all stages from infancy
to manhood. Even when our youth, leaving schools and
universities, enter that most important period of life that
begins to link study with experience, and when with that
view they visit other countries, they are not accompanied
by old domestics whom we see as governors to principal
men from other lands; three-fourths of those who go abroad
with our young nobility and gentlemen are ecclesiastics, and
they go not as austere masters or mere followers, but as
friends and companions of a graver character, and quite
often persons as well-born as those whose companions they
are. They stay closely connected to them through life. We
think that by this connection we attach our gentlemen to the
church, and we liberalise the church by conversation with
the leading characters of the country.

We are so tenacious of the old ecclesiastical modes and
fashions of institution that very little alteration has been
made in them since the 14th or 15th century; adhering in
this as in everything to our old settled maxim never entirely
or suddenly depart from antiquity. We found these old insti-
tutions, on the whole, favourable to morality and discipline,
and we thought they could be amended without altering their
foundations. We thought that they were capable of receiving
and improving and (above all) preserving the gains in science
and literature, as the order of Providence should successively
produce them. And after all, with this Gothic and monkish
education (for that’s what it is in the foundations) we may

claim that our share in the improvements in science, in arts,
and in literature that have illuminated and adorned the mod-
ern world is as large and as early as that of any other nation
in Europe. We think one main cause of this improvement
was our not despising the patrimony of knowledge left to us
by our forefathers.

It is because of our attachment to a church establishment
that the English nation did not think it wise to entrust that
great fundamental interest of the whole to what they don’t
trust with any part of their civil or military public service,
that is, to the unsteady and precarious contribution of indi-
viduals. They go further. They never did and never will suffer
the ﬁxed estate of the church to be converted into a pension,
to depend on the treasury and to be delayed, withheld, or
perhaps even extinguished by ﬁscal difﬁculties. I mean both
•supposed difﬁculties announced for political purposes and
•real difﬁculties caused by the extravagance, negligence, and
thievery of politicians. The people of England think that
they have constitutional reasons as well as religious ones
for rejecting any project of turning their independent clergy
into ecclesiastical pensioners of state. They tremble for their
liberty, from the inﬂuence of a clergy dependent on the crown;
they tremble for the public tranquillity from the disorders
of a factious clergy depending on anything other than the
crown. So they made their church, like their king and their
nobility, independent.

From the combined considerations of religion and consti-
tutional policy, from their view about the duty to make sure
provision for helping the feeble and instructing the ignorant,
they have included the estate of the church in the great
mass of private property, of which the state is in no way the
proprietor but only the guardian and the regulator. They
have ordained that the income of this establishment is to be
as stable as the earth on which it stands, and should not

56

Part 2

ﬂuctuate with the come and go of funds and actions.

The men of England—I mean the men who provide light
and leadership in England—whose wisdom (if they have any)
is open and direct, would be ashamed to profess verbally any
religion which by their actions they appear to contemn; they
would regard this as a silly deceitful trick. They understand
that if by their conduct (the only language that rarely lies)
they seemed to regard the great ruling principle of the moral
and the natural world as a mere invention to keep the
vulgar in obedience, such conduct would defeat the political
purpose they have in view. They would ﬁnd it difﬁcult to
make others believe in a system which they obviously don’t
believe themselves. The Christian statesmen of this land
would indeed ﬁrst provide for the multitude, because it is the
multitude and is therefore the ﬁrst object in the ecclesiastical
institution, and in all institutions. They have been taught
that the gospel’s being preached to the poor was one of the
great tests of its true mission. So they think that those who
do not take care to have it preached to the poor do not believe
it. But as they know that charity is not conﬁned to any one
description, but ought to apply itself to all men who have
wants, they also have a due and anxious sensation of pity
for the miserable great who are in distress. They are not
repelled through a fastidious delicacy at the stench of their
arrogance and presumption, from a medicinal attention to
their mental blotches and running sores. They are aware
that religious instruction matters more to them than to any
others, because of:

•the greatness of the temptation to which they are
exposed;
•the important consequences that come with their
faults;
•the contagion of the bad example they set;
•the need to bow down the stubborn neck of their pride

and ambition to the yoke of moderation and virtue;
•the facts about the fat stupidity and gross ignorance
concerning what imports men most to know, which
prevails at courts and at the head of armies and in
senates, as much as at the loom and in the ﬁeld.

[Burke now has a paragraph about religious ‘consolation’
needed by ‘the great’ when they are unhappy. And they very
often are, he says, speaking of the need for something ‘to ﬁll
the gloomy void that reigns in minds which have nothing on
earth to hope or fear’ and to ‘relieve the languor and lassitude
of those who have nothing to do’.]

The people of England know how little inﬂuence the
teachers of religion are likely to have on the wealthy and
powerful of long standing, and how much less on the newly
fortunate, if they (·the teachers·) appear to be much lower
in social rank than those with whom they must associate
and over whom they must sometimes even exercise a kind
of authority. What must the wealthy and powerful think
of that body of teachers if they see it at the level of their
domestic servants? If their poverty were voluntary, there
might be some difference. Strong instances of self-denial
operate powerfully on our minds, and a man who has no
wants has obtained great freedom and ﬁrmness and even
dignity. But the mass of any description of men are only
men, and in most cases their poverty cannot be voluntary; so
the disrespect that comes with all •lay poverty will also come
with •ecclesiastical poverty. . . . For these reasons, we have
not relegated religion (like something we were ashamed to
show) to obscure municipalities or rustic villages. No! we will
have her to exalt her mitred front in courts and parliaments.
We will have her mixed throughout the whole mass of life and
blended with all the classes of society. The people of England
will show to the haughty potentates of the world, and to their
talking logical tricksters, that a free, generous, and informed

57

nation honours the high magistrates of its church; that it will
not allow the insolence of wealth and titles, or any other kind
of proud pretension, to look down with scorn on what they
looked up to with reverence. . . . They can see, without pain
or grudging, an archbishop precede a duke. They can see a
bishop of Durham or of Winchester in possession of £10,000
a year, and cannot see why this is worse than a similar
estate in the hands of this earl or that squire, although it
may be true that so many dogs and horses are not kept by
the former and fed with the victuals that ought to nourish
the children of the people. It is true that the whole church
income is not always employed in charity, nor perhaps ought
it to be, but something is generally employed. It is better to
cherish virtue and humanity by leaving much to free will,
even with some loss to the objective, than to try to make men
mere machines and instruments of a political benevolence.
The world on the whole will gain by a liberty without which
virtue cannot exist.

Once the commonwealth has established the estates of
the church as property, it can’t in consistency hear anything
of the more or the less. ‘Too much’ and ‘too little’ are treason
against property. What evil can arise from the quantity in
any hand while the supreme authority has the full, sovereign
superintendence over this, as over all property, to prevent
every kind of abuse and whenever it notably deviates to give
it a direction agreeable to the purposes of its institution?

In England most of us think that when some people look
disapprovingly at the distinctions, honours, and revenues
that are not taken from anyone and are set apart for virtue,
they are driven not by •love of the self-denial and mortiﬁca-
tion of the ancient church, but by •envy and malignity toward
those who are often the beginners of their own fortune. The
people of England have sharp ears. They hear these men
speak in a vulgar and coarse way. Their tongue betrays them.

Their language is in the patois of fraud, in the cant and
gibberish of hypocrisy. The people of England must think so
when these idle talkers purport to carry the clergy back to
[what follows is their account of it:]

the primitive, evangelic poverty which in spirit ought
always to exist in them (and in us too, whether we
like it or not), but in reality must be varied when the
relation of the church to the state is altered—when
manners, modes of life, indeed the whole order of
human affairs has undergone a total revolution.

We shall believe these reformers to be honest extremists—
rather than, as we now think them, cheats and deceivers—
when we see them putting their own goods into the common
pool and submitting their own persons to the austere disci-
pline of the early church.

With these ideas rooted in their minds, the commons
of Great Britain will never in national emergencies have
recourse to the conﬁscation of the estates of the church
and poor. . . . There is not one public man in this kingdom
whom you would wish to quote—not one, of any party or
description—who does not condemn the dishonest, perﬁdi-
ous, and cruel conﬁscation that the National Assembly has
been compelled to make of property that it was their ﬁrst
duty to protect.

With the pleasure of a little national pride, I tell you that
those among us who have wished to drink the health of
the societies of Paris with the cup of their abominations
have been disappointed. The robbery of your church has
proved a security to the possession of ours. It has roused the
people. They see with horror and alarm that enormous and
shameless act of proscription. It has opened. . . .their eyes
to the selﬁsh enlargement of mind and the narrow liberality
of sentiment of insidious men, which, starting in hypocrisy
and fraud, have ended in open violence and theft. At home

58

we behold similar beginnings. We are on our guard against
similar conclusions.

The conﬁscators

I hope we shall never be so totally lost to all sense of the
duties imposed on us by the law of social union as to use
the excuse of ‘public service’ to conﬁscate the goods of
a single unoffending citizen. Who but a tyrant. . . .could
think of seizing the property of men unaccused, unheard,
untried, by whole descriptions [see Glossary], by hundreds
and thousands together? Who that hadn’t lost every trace
of humanity could think of casting down men of exalted
rank and sacred function, some of them of an age to call
for both reverence and compassion—casting them down
from the highest situation in the commonwealth, where they
were maintained by their own landed property, to a state of
indigence, depression, and contempt?

The conﬁscators have indeed made some allowance to
their victims from the scraps and fragments of their own
tables from which they have been so harshly driven, tables
that have been so bountifully spread for a feast to the greedy
predators of usury. But to drive men from independence to
live on alms is itself great cruelty. A condition that might be
tolerable to men in one state of life who aren’t habituated to
other things may to others be a dreadful revolution—one to
which a virtuous mind would feel pain in condemning any
guilt except guilt that would demand the offender’s life. But
to many minds this punishment of degradation and infamy is
worse than death. Undoubtedly it makes this cruel suffering
inﬁnitely worse that the persons who were taught a double
prejudice in favour of religion, by education and by the place
they held in the administration of its functions, are to receive
the remnants of their property as alms from the profane

and impious hands of those who had robbed them of all the
rest; to receive (if they are to receive anything) not from the
charitable contributions of the faithful but from the insolent
tenderness of known and avowed atheism, the maintenance
of religion doled out to them by the measure of the contempt
in which it is held, and for the purpose of making those who
receive the allowance vile and of no estimation in the eyes of
mankind.

But this act of seizure of property, it seems, is a judgment
in law and not a conﬁscation. They have, it seems, found
out in the academies of the Palais Royal and the Jacobins
that certain men had no right to the possessions that they
held under law, usage, the decisions of courts, and the
accumulated prescription [see Glossary] of a thousand years.
They say that ecclesiastics are ﬁctitious persons, creatures of
the state, whom at pleasure they may destroy, and of course
limit and alter in every particular; that their possessions are
not properly theirs but belong to the state, which created
the ﬁction; and we are therefore not to trouble ourselves
with what they may suffer in their •natural feelings and
•natural persons on account of what is done toward them
in this their •created-ﬁction character. What does it matter
under what labels you injure men and deprive them of the
just emoluments [see Glossary] of a profession that they were
not only permitted but encouraged by the state to engage
in—emoluments whose supposed certainty was the basis on
which they had formed the plan of their lives, contracted
debts, and led multitudes to an entire dependence on them?
You do not imagine, Sir, that I am going to compliment
this miserable distinction of persons—·the distinction be-
tween the ﬁctional ofﬁcial and the natural man·—with any
long discussion. Tyrannny’s arguments are as contemptible
as its force is dreadful. If your conﬁscators had not by their
early crimes obtained a power that gives them indemnity for

59

Reﬂections on the Revolution in France

Edmund Burke

Part 2

all their later crimes, what would have refuted a logical trick
that becomes an accomplice of theft and murder would have
been not the syllogism of the logician but the lash of the
executioner. . . .

This outrage on all the rights of property was at ﬁrst
covered with what, on the system of their conduct, was
the most astonishing of all excuses—a regard for national
faith. The enemies of property at ﬁrst claimed to have a most
tender, delicate, and scrupulous anxiety for keeping the
king’s engagements with the public creditor [i.e. for paying the
king’s debts to creditors other than private citizens]. These professors
of the rights of men are so busy teaching others that they
have no spare time in which to learn anything themselves;
otherwise they would have known that the ﬁrst and original
faith of civil society is pledged to the property of the citizen,
and not to the demands of the creditor of the state. The claim
of the citizen is prior in time, paramount in title, superior
in equity. The fortunes of individuals, whether possessed
by acquisition or by descent or in virtue of a participation
in the goods of some community, were not—explicitly or
implicitly—any part of the creditor’s security [i.e. any part of
the collateral for his loan]. They never entered his head when he
made his bargain. He well knew that the public, whether
represented by a monarch or by a senate, can pledge nothing
but the public estate; and it can have no public estate except
in what it derives from a just and proportioned imposition
[here = ‘tax’] on the citizens at large. This was engaged, and
nothing else could be engaged, to the public creditor. No
man can mortgage his injustice as a pawn for his ﬁdelity.
[That brilliant last sentence unpacks into this: ‘No man can take out a
loan on this basis: “I don’t have any collateral; but I promise that the
loan will be repaid when it falls due because I can (and if necessary will)
do X, which will bring me enough money to repay it”, where X is some
kind of criminal activity.’]

60

Old nobility versus new money

I have to say something about the contradictions caused
by the extreme rigor and the extreme laxity of this new
‘public faith’ that inﬂuenced this transaction, doing so
not according to the nature of the obligation but to the
description of the persons to whom it was engaged. No
acts of the old government of the kings of France are held
valid in the National Assembly except its pecuniary [see
Glossary] engagements—which are in fact acts of the most
ambiguous legality. The other acts of that royal government
are considered in so odious a light that to have a claim under
its authority is looked on as a sort of crime. A pension, given
as a reward for service to the state, is surely as good a basis
for ownership as any security for money advanced to the
state. It is better; for money is paid, and well paid, to obtain
that service. But we have seen multitudes of people under
this description in France who had never been deprived of
their allowances by the most arbitrary ministers in the most
arbitrary times, robbed without mercy by this assembly of
‘the rights of men’. When they laid claim to the bread that
had been earned by their labour, they were told that their
services had not been rendered to the country that now
exists.

This laxity of public faith is not conﬁned to those un-
fortunate persons. The Assembly, with perfect consistency
it must be admitted, is engaged in a respectable delibera-
tion concerning how far it is bound by the treaties made
with other nations under the former government, and their
committee is to report which of them they ought to ratify,
and which not. By this means they have put the external
trustworthiness of this virgin state on a par with its internal
trustworthiness.

Reﬂections on the Revolution in France

Edmund Burke

Part 2

It is not easy to conceive any rational principle according

to which the royal government did not have

•the power of rewarding service and making treaties,
in virtue of its prerogative,

rather than

•the power of pledging to creditors the actual and
possible revenue of the state.

The treasure of the nation has been of all things the least
allowed to the prerogative of the king of France or of any
king in Europe. To mortgage the public revenue implies
the sovereign dominion, in the fullest sense, over the pub-
lic purse.
It goes far beyond the trust of temporary and
occasional taxation. The acts of that dangerous power—
·sovereign dominion over the public purse·—are the distinc-
tive mark of a boundless despotism; yet they alone have been
held sacred! Where did it come from, this preference of a
democratic assembly for a body of property rising from the
most critical and obnoxious of all the exercises of monar-
chical authority? Reason can furnish nothing to reconcile
inconsistency, nor can partial favour be accounted for on
equitable principles. But though there is no justiﬁcation
for the contradiction or the partiality, they do have a cause
which I do not think is hard to discover.

Through the vast debt of France a great moneyed interest
had gradually grown up, and with it a great power. By the
ancient usages that prevailed in that kingdom, the general
circulation of property, and in particular the convertibility of
land into money and vice versa, had always been difﬁcult.

•Family settlements, rather more general and more
strict than they are in England,. . . .
•the great mass of landed property held by the crown
and, by a maxim of the French law, held inalienably,
•the vast estates of the ecclesiastical corporations

—all these had kept the landed and moneyed interests more

separated in France, less miscible, and kept the owners of
the two kinds of property less well disposed to each other,
than they are in this country.

The moneyed property was long looked on with rather an
evil eye by the people. They saw it as connected with their
distresses and making them worse. It was no less envied by
the old landed interests, partly for the same reasons that
made it obnoxious to the people, but much more because
it eclipsed, by the splendour of an ostentatious luxury, the
unendowed pedigrees and naked titles of many of the nobility
[i.e. nobles who had nothing but their titles as nobility]. Even when
•the nobility that represented the more permanent landed
interest united themselves by marriage (which sometimes
was the case) with •the other description [see Glossary], the
wealth that saved a noble family from ruin was thought to
contaminate and degrade it. Thus the enmities and heart-
burnings of these parties were increased even by the means
by which discord is usually made to cease and quarrels are
turned into friendship. In the meantime, the pride of the
wealthy men, not noble or newly noble, increased with its
cause. They felt with resentment an inferiority whose basis
they did not acknowledge. There was nothing they were not
willing to do to get revenge for the outrages of this rival pride
and to exalt their wealth to what they regarded as its natural
rank and esteem. They struck at the nobility through the
crown and the church. They attacked them particularly on
the side on which they thought them the most vulnerable,
namely the possessions of the church, which through the
patronage of the crown generally came to the nobility.

The bishoprics and the great land-owning abbeys were

nearly all held by the nobility.

In this state of real (though not always perceived) warfare
between the noble ancient landed interest and the new
moneyed interest, the latter was stronger because its power

61

Reﬂections on the Revolution in France

Edmund Burke

Part 2

was easier to deploy. The moneyed interest is in its nature
more ready for any adventure, and its possessors are more
disposed to new enterprises of any kind. Being of recent
acquisition, it goes along more naturally with any novelties.
So it is the kind of wealth that will be resorted to by all who
wish for change.

Political men of letters

Along with the moneyed interest, a new description of men
had grown up with whom the moneyed interest soon formed
a close and marked union—I mean the political men of letters.
Men of letters like to stand out, so they are rarely averse
to innovation. Since the decline of the life and greatness
of Louis XIV they were not so much cultivated by him or
the regent or the successors to the crown, and not bound
to the court by favours and emoluments as systematically
as during the splendid period of that ostentatious and not
impolitic reign. What they lost in the old court protection
they tried to make up by joining in a sort of incorporation
of their own; to which the two academies of France, and
afterwards the vast undertaking of the Encyclopedia carried
on by a society of these gentlemen, contributed considerably.
Some years ago the literary cabal had formed something
like a regular plan for the destruction of the Christian
religion. They pursued this objective with a degree of zeal
that until then had been exhibited only by the propagators
of some system of piety. They were possessed with a spirit
of proselytism in the most fanatical degree; and from that
they easily slid into a spirit of persecution according to their
means. What was not to be done toward their great end by
any direct or immediate act could be brought about by a
longer process through public opinion. To command that
opinion, the ﬁrst step is to get control of those who direct it.

With great method and perseverance they managed to get
possession of all the avenues to literary fame. Many of them
indeed stood high in the ranks of literature and science.
The world had done them justice, and because of their
general talents it forgave the evil tendency of their special
principles. This was true liberality, which they returned
by trying to conﬁne the reputation for sense, learning, and
taste to themselves or their followers. I venture to say that
this narrow, exclusive spirit has been just as harmful to
literature and taste as to morals and true philosophy. These
atheistical fathers have a bigotry of their own, and they have
learned to talk against monks with the spirit of a monk. But
in some things they are men of the world. The resources of
intrigue are called in to make up for the defects of argument
and wit. This system of literary monopoly was combined
with unremitting efforts to blacken and discredit—in every
way and by every means—all those who did not belong to
their faction. To those who have observed the spirit of their
conduct it has been clear for years that all they lacked was
the power to move from the intolerance of the tongue and
pen to a persecution that would strike at property, liberty,
and life.

The casual and faint persecution carried on against them,
more from compliance with form and decency than from
resentment, did not weaken their strength or relax their
efforts. The outcome of the whole situation—including
opposition and success—was that a violent and malignant
zeal, of a previously unknown kind, took complete possession
of their minds and made their whole conversation, which
otherwise would have been pleasing and instructive, perfectly
disgusting. A spirit of cabal, intrigue, and proselytism
pervaded all their thoughts, words, and actions. And as
controversial zeal soon turns its thoughts on force, they
began to insinuate themselves into a correspondence with

62

Reﬂections on the Revolution in France

Edmund Burke

Part 2

foreign princes, hoping that through their authority, which
at ﬁrst they ﬂattered, they might bring about the changes
they had in view. They didn’t care whether these changes
were to be accomplished by •the thunderbolt of despotism
or •the earthquake of popular commotion. . . . For that same
purpose they conspicuously cultivated the moneyed interest
of France; and partly through the means provided by those
whose ofﬁces gave them the most extensive and certain
means of communication, they carefully occupied all the
avenues to opinion.

Writers, especially when they act in a body and with one
direction, have great inﬂuence on the public mind; so the
alliance of these writers with the moneyed interest had a
big effect in removing the popular odium and envy evoked
by that sort of wealth. These writers, like the propagators
of all novelties, claimed to have a great zeal for the poor
and the lower orders, while in their satires they used every
exaggeration to make horrible the faults of courts, of nobility,
and of priesthood. They became a sort of demagogues. They
served as a link to unite obnoxious wealth with restless and
desperate poverty, all in the service of one objective.

As these two kinds of men (·the wealthy and the writers·)
appear to be principal leaders in all the recent doings, their
combination and politics will serve to account—not on any
principles of law or of policy but as a cause—for the general
fury with which all the landed property of ecclesiastical
corporations has been attacked; and the great care which,
contrary to their pretended principles, has been taken of a
moneyed interest originating from the authority of the crown.
All the envy against wealth and power was skillfully directed
against other descriptions of riches. How else can we account
for an appearance so extraordinary and unnatural as that of
the ecclesiastical possessions,

which had survived so many successions of ages and
shocks of civil violences, and were protected at once
by justice and by prejudice,

being applied to the payment of comparatively recent debts—
invidious debts contracted by a decried and subverted
government? [This hooks up with the paragraph starting ‘This out-
rage. . . ’ on page 60.]

Conﬁscation

Was the public estate a sufﬁcient stake for the public debts?
Assume that it was not, and that a loss must be incurred
somewhere. When the only estate lawfully possessed—the
only one the contracting parties had in mind at the time when
their bargain was made—happens to fail, who according to
the principles of natural and legal fairness ought to suffer
the loss? Certainly it ought to be either the party who trusted
or the party who persuaded him to trust, or both, and not
third parties who had no concern with the transaction. When
an insolvency occurs, the loss should be suffered by those
who are weak enough to lend on bad security, or those who
fraudulently held out a security that was not valid. Laws
are acquainted with no other rules of decision. But by the
new institute of the rights of men the only persons who in
fairness ought to suffer the loss are the only persons who
are to be protected from it; the debt is to be paid by those
who were neither lenders nor borrowers, neither mortgagers
nor mortgagees.

What had the clergy to do with these transactions? What
had they to do with any public engagement other than their
own debt? To that their estates were certainly bound to the
last acre. Nothing can show better the true spirit of the
·National· Assembly—which sits for public conﬁscation, with
its new equity and its new morality—than their handling

of this debt of the clergy. The body of conﬁscators, true to
the moneyed interest for the sake of which they were false
to every other, have found the clergy competent to incur a
legal debt. Of course, they declared them legally entitled to
the property which their power of incurring the debt and
mortgaging the estate implied, recognizing the rights of those
persecuted citizens in the very act in which their rights were
thus grossly violated.

If any persons are to make good deﬁciencies to the public
creditor, other than the public at large, they must be those
who managed the agreement. So why aren’t the estates of all
the comptrollers-general conﬁscated? Why not those of the
long succession of ministers, ﬁnanciers, and bankers who
have been enriched while the nation was impoverished by
their dealings and their advice? Why is not the estate of M.
Laborde declared forfeited rather than of the archbishop of
Paris, who had no part in the creation or in the jobbing of
the public funds? And if you must conﬁscate old landed
estates rather than those of the money-jobbers, why is
the penalty conﬁned to one description? I do not know
whether the Duke de Choiseul’s expenses have left anything
of the inﬁnite sums he had derived from the bounty of his
master during the transactions of a reign which contributed
largely—by every sort of extravagance in war and peace—to
the present debt of France. If any of it does remain, why
is it not conﬁscated? I remember being in Paris during the
time of the old government. I was there just after the Duke
d’Aiguillon had been (as it was generally thought) snatched
from the block by the hand of a protecting despotism.

He was a minister and had some concern in the affairs
of that spendthrift period. Why do I not see his estate
delivered up to the municipalities in which it is situated? The
noble family of Noailles have long been servants (meritorious
servants I admit) to the crown of France, and have of course

had some share in its bounties. Why do I hear nothing of the
application of their estates to the public debt? Why is the
estate of the Duke de Rochefoucault more sacred than that
of the Cardinal de Rochefoucault? The Duke is no doubt a
worthy person, and he makes a good use of his revenues
(though really it is a sort of profaneness to talk as though
someone’s ownership of his property was affected by how he
uses it.) But it is no disrespect to the Duke to say, on the
basis of authentic information, that the use by his brother
the Cardinal of his property was far more laudable and far
more public-spirited. Can one hear of the proscription of
such persons and the conﬁscation of their effects without
indignation and horror? Anyone who does not feel such
emotions on such occasions is not a man. Anyone who won’t
express them does not deserve the name of a freeman.

Few barbarous conquerors have ever made so terrible
a revolution in property. None of the heads of the Roman
factions, when they auctioned off things they had acquired
by violence, ever offered for sale such an enormous amount
of the goods of the conquered citizen. It must be allowed
in favour of those tyrants of antiquity that they can hardly
be said to have acted in cold blood. Their passions were
inﬂamed, their tempers soured, their understandings con-
fused with the spirit of revenge, with the innumerable recent
inﬂictions and retaliations of blood and plunder. They were
driven beyond all bounds of moderation by fear of the return
of power, with the return of property, to the families of those
they had injured beyond all hope of forgiveness.

But these Roman conﬁscators, who were only at the early
stages of tyranny and were not instructed in ‘the rights of
men’ to practise all sorts of cruelties on each other without
provocation, thought it necessary to spread a sort of colour
over their injustice.

They considered the vanquished party as composed of

64

traitors who had borne arms against the commonwealth or
otherwise acted with hostility towards it . They regarded
them as having forfeited their property by their crimes. With
you ·in contemporary France·, in your improved state of
the human mind, there was no such formality. You seized
£5,000,000 sterling of annual rent and turned more than
40,000 human creatures out of their houses, because ‘such
was your pleasure’. The tyrant Henry VIII of England, being
no more enlightened than the Roman Mariuses and Sullas
and not having studied in your new schools, did not know
what an effectual instrument of despotism was to be found
in that grand magazine of offensive weapons, ‘the rights of
men’. When he decided to rob the abbeys, as the club of
the Jacobins have robbed all the ecclesiastics, he began
by setting up a commission to look into the crimes and
abuses that prevailed in those communities. As might be
expected, his commission reported truths, exaggerations,
and falsehoods. But it did, whether truly or falsely, report
abuses and offences. However, because

•abuses might be corrected,
•every crime of individuals does not imply a forfeiture
with regard to communities, and
•property, in that dark age, was not revealed to be a
creature of prejudice,

all those abuses (and there were enough of them) were hardly
thought sufﬁcient ground for such a complete conﬁscation
as he proposed to make.
[In the above list, the third item is
of course meant sarcastically.] So he procured the formal sur-
render of these estates. All these laborious proceedings
were adopted by one of the worst tyrants in history as
necessary preliminaries before he could venture—by bribing
the members of his two servile houses with a share of the
spoils and holding out to them an eternal immunity from
taxation—to demand an act of parliament that would conﬁrm

his iniquitous proceedings. Had fate reserved him to our
times, four technical terms would have done his business
and saved him all this trouble; all he needed was one short
form of incantation—‘Philosophy, Light, Liberality, the Rights
of Men’.

I can say nothing in praise of acts of tyranny that no voice
has hitherto ever commended under any of their false colours,
yet in these false colours homage was paid by despotism to
justice. The power that was above all fear and all remorse
was not set above all shame. While shame keeps its watch,
virtue is not wholly extinguished in the heart and moderation
will not be utterly exiled from the minds of tyrants.

I believe every honest man sympathises in his reﬂections
with our political poet [Denham, "Cooper’s Hill"] on that occasion,
and will pray to avert the omen whenever these acts of
rapacious despotism present themselves to his view or his
imagination:

May no such storm
Fall on our times, where ruin must reform.
Tell me (my Muse) what monstrous dire offence,
What crimes could any Christian king incense
To such a rage? Was’t luxury, or lust?
Was he so temperate, so chaste, so just?
Were these their crimes? they were his own much

more,

But wealth is crime enough to him that’s poor.

This same wealth. . . .was your temptation to violate property,
law, and religion, united in one object. But was the state of
France so wretched and undone that nothing but theft could
preserve its existence? On this point I want information.
When the states met, was the condition of the ﬁnances of
France such that, after economising on principles of justice

65

Part 2

and mercy through all departments [this term is explained on
page 95], no fair sharing of burdens through all the orders
could possibly restore them? If such an equal imposition
would have been sufﬁcient, you know very well that it could
easily have been made.

M. Necker, in the budget which he laid before the orders
assembled at Versailles, made a detailed exposition of the
state of the French nation. According to him, it was not
necessary to resort to any new impositions whatsoever to put
France’s receipts in balance with its expenses. [Details about
this are given. Then:] He concludes with these emphatic
words [Burke quotes the original French]:

‘What a country this is, gentlemen, which can make
disappear a deﬁcit that has made such a noise in
Europe, without compulsory fees and with simple
procedures that no-one will notice.’

As for the •procedures indicated in M. Necker’s speech, there
can be no doubt that a very moderate and proportioned
assessment on all the citizens, without distinction, would
have provided for all of •them to the fullest extent of their
demand.
[He gives some details regarding how Necker
proposed to do this. Then:]

If what M. Necker said was false, the Assembly are highly
culpable for having forced the king to accept as his minister—
and, since the king’s deposition, for having employed as their
minister—a man who could abuse so notoriously his master’s
conﬁdence and theirs, in a matter of the highest importance
and relating directly to his particular ofﬁce. But like you I
have a high degree of respect for M. Necker, and I have no
doubt that what he said was exact; and in that case what
can be said in favour of those who, instead of moderate,
reasonable, and general contribution, have—in cold blood
and with no necessity to do so—resorted to a partial and
cruel conﬁscation?

Was that contribution refused on the excuse of ‘privilege’
by the clergy or the nobility? No, certainly. As for the clergy,
they even went ahead of the wishes of the third order [= ‘of
the commons’]. Before the meeting of the states, they had
in all their instructions explicitly directed their deputies to
renounce every immunity that put them on a different footing
from that of their fellow subjects. In this renunciation the
clergy were even more explicit than the nobility.

[Burke now has (i) a paragraph arguing that even if
Necker’s mild proposals for dealing with the debt had been
rubbish, and even if it had been all right to lay the whole bur-
den of the debt on the clergy, the imposition of the amount
needed ‘would not have been altogether ruinous to those
on whom it was imposed’; and (ii) a paragraph maintaining
that, contrary to what people might think, the clergy and
the nobility of France had contributed considerably to the
state, ‘though not equally with each other, nor either of them
equally with the commons’. He gives details. Then:]

When the terrors of this tremendous proscription hung
over the clergy, they made an offer of a contribution through
the archbishop of Aix; it was so extravagant that it ought
not to have been accepted. But it was obviously more
advantageous to the public creditor than anything that could
rationally be promised by the conﬁscation. Why was it not
accepted? The reason is plain: there was no desire that the
church should be brought to serve the state. The service of
the state was made a pretext to destroy the church. They
had no scruples about destroying the church by means that
would also destroy their country; and they have destroyed it.
Another great aim of the project would have been defeated
if the plan of extortion—·e.g. accepting the offer from the
archbishop of Aix·—had been adopted instead of the scheme
of conﬁscation. The new landed interest connected with the
new republic, and connected with it for its very being, could

66

Reﬂections on the Revolution in France

Edmund Burke

Part 2

not have been created. This was among the reasons why
that extravagant ransom was not accepted.

The effects of conﬁscation

The madness of the initial plan for conﬁscation soon became
apparent. To bring into the market all at once this unwieldy
mass of landed property, enlarged by the conﬁscation of
all the crown’s vast lands, was obviously to defeat the
proﬁts aimed at by the conﬁscation, because it would lower
the value of those lands and indeed of all France’s landed
estates. Another drawback was the sudden diversion of all
the country’s circulating money from trade to land. What
step was taken? Did the Assembly, on becoming aware of the
inevitable ill effects of their projected sale, revert to the offers
of the clergy? No distress could make them take a course that
was disgraced by any appearance of justice! Giving over all
hopes from a general immediate sale, another project seems
to have taken the place of that one. [They soon dropped that,
Burke says, because of other difﬁculties, and returned to the
idea of sale, but with a difference.] Many municipalities had
been reduced to the most deplorable poverty. Money was
nowhere to be seen. They–·the National Assembly·—were
therefore led to the point that was so ardently desired. They
panted for a currency of any kind that could revive their
perishing industry. The municipalities were to be admitted
to a share in the spoils, which evidently made the original
scheme. . . .altogether impracticable. Public needs pressed
in on all sides. The minister of ﬁnance reiterated his call
for revenue with a most urgent, anxious, and boding voice.
Thus pressed on all sides, instead of the ﬁrst plan of turning
their bankers into bishops and abbots, instead of paying
the old debt, they contracted a new debt at 3%, creating a
new paper currency based on an eventual sale of the church

lands. They issued this paper currency to satisfy in the ﬁrst
instance chieﬂy the demands made on them by the Bank of
discount, the great paper-mill of their ﬁctitious wealth.

The spoil of the church had now become the only resource
of all their operations in ﬁnance, the vital principle of all their
politics, the sole security for the existence of their power. It
was necessary by any means, even the most violent, to put
every individual on the same footing, and to bind the nation
in one guilty interest to uphold this act and the authority
of those by whom it was done. In order to force the most
reluctant into sharing in their pillage, they made their paper
money compulsory in all payments. Those who consider the
general tendency of their schemes to this one objective as a
centre from which then all their measures radiate will not
think I am spending too long on this part of the National
Assembly’s proceedings.

To cut off all appearance of connection between the crown
and public justice, and to bring the whole under implicit
obedience to the dictators in Paris, the old independent
judicature of the parlements [see Glossary], with all its merits
and all its faults, was wholly abolished. While the par-
lements existed, the people might sometimes resort to them
and rally under the standard of their ancient laws. But
thought had to be given to the fact that the magistrates
and ofﬁcers in the courts now abolished had purchased
their places at a very high price, for which—as well as
for the duty they performed—they received only a very
low rate of return. Simple conﬁscation is a boon only for
the clergy; for the lawyers some appearances of fairness
are to be observed, and they are to receive compensation
adding up to an immense amount. Their compensation
becomes part of the national debt, for the liquidation of
which there is the one inexhaustible fund. The lawyers are
to get their compensation in the new church paper ·money·,

67

Reﬂections on the Revolution in France

Part 2

which is in step with the new principles of judicature and
legislature. The dismissed magistrates are to take their share
of martyrdom with the ecclesiastics, meaning that they will
receive their own property in a manner that must be looked
on with horror by all those who have been seasoned with the
ancient principles of jurisprudence and have been the sworn
guardians of property. And the clergy must either •starve
or •receive their miserable allowance out of the depreciated
paper ·money·, which is stamped with the indelible character
of sacrilege and with the symbols of their own ruin. The
alliance of bankruptcy and tyranny has seldom committed
an outrage against credit, property, and liberty as violent as
this compulsory paper currency.

In the course of all these operations it eventually comes
to light that in reality, and in a fair sense, the lands of the
church are not to be sold at all. By the recent resolutions
of the National Assembly, they are indeed to be delivered to
the highest bidder. But notice that only a certain portion
of the purchase money is to be laid down, with a period
of twelve years allowed for the payment of the rest. The
philosophic purchasers are therefore, on payment of a sort
of ﬁne, to be put instantly into possession of the estate. It
becomes in some respects a sort of gift to them—to be held on
the feudal condition of zeal to the new establishment. This
project is evidently to let in a body of purchasers without
money. The consequence will be that ·after twelve years·
these purchasers, or rather grant-recipients, will pay ·the
remainder of the purchase price· from

•the rents as they accrue, which might as well be
received by the state, and
•the spoil of the materials of buildings,
•waste in woods, and
•whatever money they can wring from the miserable
peasant by hands practised in the gripings of usury.

The peasant is to be delivered over to the mercenary and
arbitrary discretion of men who will be stimulated to every
sort of extortion by the growing demands on the growing
proﬁts of an estate held under the precarious settlement of a
new political system.

When all the frauds, impostures, violences, thefts, burn-
ings, murders, conﬁscations, compulsory paper currencies,
and every kind of tyranny and cruelty employed to create and
uphold this Revolution have their natural effect—namely,
to shock the moral sentiments of all virtuous and sober
minds—the abettors of this philosophic system immediately
strain their throats in a declamation against the old monar-
chical government of France. When they have blackened that
deposed power sufﬁciently, they then proceed in argument
as if •all those who disapprove of their new abuses must of
course be partisans of the old, as if •those who criticise their
crude and violent schemes of ‘liberty’ ought to be treated
as advocates for servitude. Their needs do indeed compel
them to this base and contemptible fraud. Nothing can
reconcile men to their proceedings and projects but the
supposition that there is no third option between •them
and •some tyranny as odious as can be furnished by the
records of history or the invention of poets. This prattling
of theirs hardly deserves the name of sophistry [see Glossary].
It is nothing but plain impudence. Have these gentlemen
never heard, in the whole circle of the worlds of theory and
practice, of anything between the despotism of the monarch
and the despotism of the multitude? Have they never heard
of a monarchy directed by laws, controlled and balanced
by the great hereditary wealth and hereditary dignity of a
nation, and both again controlled by a judicious check from
the reason and feeling of the people at large acting by a
suitable and permanent organ ·such as the English House of
Commons·? Is it then impossible to ﬁnd a man who (without

68

Part 2

criminal ill intention or pitiable absurdity) •prefers such a
mixed and tempered government to either of the extremes,
and who •regards as destitute of all wisdom and all virtue
any country which, having in its choice to obtain such a
government with ease, or rather to conﬁrm it when actually
possessed, thought it proper to commit a thousand crimes
and to subject their country to a thousand evils in order
to avoid it? ‘A pure democracy is the only tolerable form
into which human society can be thrown’—is that a truth
so universally acknowledged that a man is not permitted to
hesitate about its merits without the suspicion of being a
friend to tyranny, i.e. a foe to mankind?

What is wrong with absolute democracy

I do not know under what description to class the present
ruling authority in France. It purports to be a pure democ-
racy, though I think it is heading towards soon being a
wicked and ignoble oligarchy. But for the present I admit it
to be a contrivance with the nature and effect that it claims
to have. I don’t reject any form of government merely on
abstract principles. There may be situations in which the
purely democratic form will become necessary. There may
be some (very few, and in very special circumstances) where
it would be clearly desirable. I do not take this to be the case
of France or of any other great country. Until now, we have
seen no examples of considerable democracies. The ancients
were better acquainted with them. Not being wholly unread
in the authors who had seen the most of those constitutions,
and who best understood them, I cannot help agreeing with
their opinion that an absolute democracy is no more to be
reckoned among the legitimate forms of government than
absolute monarchy. They think it to be the corruption and
degeneracy of a republic rather than a sound constitution.

If I recollect rightly, Aristotle observes that a democracy has
many striking points of resemblance with a tyranny. Of
this I am certain, that in a democracy, whenever strong
divisions prevail (as they often must in that kind of polity),
the majority of the citizens is capable of cruelly oppressing
the minority, and that this oppression will extend to far
greater numbers and will be carried on with much greater
fury than can almost ever be feared from a monarchy. In
such a popular persecution, individual sufferers are in a
much more deplorable condition than in any other. Under a
cruel prince they have the soothing compassion of mankind
to lessen the sting of their wounds; they have the plaudits of
the people to strengthen their good-hearted constancy under
their sufferings; but those who are wronged by multitudes
are deprived of all external consolation. They seem deserted
by mankind, overpowered by a conspiracy of their whole
species.

The faults of the French monarchy

But suppose that I am wrong and democracy does not have
an inevitable tendency to party tyranny, and suppose it to
have as much good in it when unmixed [= absolute] as I am
sure it has when compounded with other forms, does monar-
chy contain nothing at all to recommend it? I do not often
quote Bolingbroke,. . . .but he has one observation which,
in my opinion, is not without depth and solidity. He says
that he prefers a monarchy to other governments because
you can better graft any kind of republic onto a monarchy
than graft anything of monarchy onto the republican forms.
I think he is perfectly right. The fact is so historically, and it
agrees well with political theory.

I know how easy it is to dwell on the faults of departed
greatness. By a revolution in the state, the fawning ﬂatterer

69

Reﬂections on the Revolution in France

Part 2

of yesterday is converted into the austere critic of the
present hour. But steady, independent minds, when they
are thinking about something as important to mankind
as government, will disdain to join with the satirists and
declaimers. They will judge human institutions as they do
human characters. They will sort out the good from the evil
that is mixed in mortal institutions as it is in mortal men.

Your government in France was usually (and I think
justly) reputed to be the best of the unqualiﬁed or ill-qualiﬁed
monarchies; but it was still full of abuses. [He means: absolute
monarchies or ones that weren’t quite absolute but whose other ingredi-
ents were unsatisfactory.] These abuses accumulated over time,
as they must accumulate in every monarchy that is not under
the constant inspection of a popular representative. I am
no stranger to the faults and defects of the now-subverted
government of France, and I am not inclined by nature
or policy to sing the praises of anything that is a just and
natural object of censure. But our present question concerns
not the vices of that monarchy but its existence. So: was the
French government so incapable or so undeserving of reform
that it was absolutely necessary that the whole structure
should be at once pulled down and the area cleared for the
erection of a theoretical experimental ediﬁce in its place? At
the beginning of 1789 all France was of a different opinion.
The instructions to the representatives to the States-General
from every district in that kingdom were ﬁlled with projects
for reforming that government without the remotest sugges-
tion of a plan to destroy it. Had such a plan been even hinted
at, I believe there would have been only one voice—a voice
for rejecting it with scorn and horror. Men have sometimes
been led gradually, and sometimes been hurried, into things
they would never have come anywhere near to if they could
have seen the whole together. When those instructions ·from
the districts· were given, there was no doubt that abuses

existed, and that they demanded reform; nor is there now.
In the interval between the instructions and the revolution,
things changed their shape. So the true question now is:
who are are in the right—those who would have reformed or
those who have destroyed?

To hear some men speak of the late monarchy of France,
you would imagine that they were talking of Persia bleeding
under the ferocious sword of Tahmas Kouli Khan, or at least
describing the barbarous anarchic despotism of Turkey,

•where the ﬁnest countries in the world’s friendliest
climates are wasted by peace more than any countries
have been worried by war,
•where arts are unknown,
•where manufactures languish,
•where science is extinguished,
•where agriculture decays,
•where the human race itself melts away and perishes
under the eye of the observer.

Was this the case of France? I have no way of answering the
question except by reference to facts, and the facts answer
No. Along with much evil there is some good in monarchy
itself, and some corrective to its evil from religion, from laws,
from manners, from opinions that the French monarchy
must have received, which rendered it (though by no means
a free, and therefore by no means a good, constitution) a
despotism in appearance rather than in reality.

Population

Among the standards by which the effects of government
on any country are to be estimated, I regard the state [here
= ‘size’, apparently] of its population as not the least certain.
No country in which population ﬂourishes and is progres-
sively improving can be under a very harmful government.

70

Reﬂections on the Revolution in France

Edmund Burke

Part 2

About sixty years ago the population of France was even at
that period estimated to be 22,000,000 souls. (Or so I believe.
The relevant documents are very voluminous, and I do not
have them or know where to get them; so I have to speak
from memory, and therefore less positively.) At the end of the
last century it had been generally calculated at 18,000,000.
On either of these estimations, France was not ill peopled. M.
Necker, who is an authority for his own time. . . ., reckons the
people of France in 1780 at 24,670,000, and his basis for this
appears to be sound. [Then some complicated stuff about
how much the French population increased between 1780
and 1789. Burke is doubtful about the highest estimate that
had been made, and continues:] I have no doubt that the
population of France did increase considerably during this
later period; but supposing that it increased only enough
to bring it up to 25,000,000, still a population of that size
(and still growing) in a space of about 27,000 square leagues
is immense. It is, for instance, a good deal more than the
proportionable population of this island, or even than that
of England, the best peopled part of the United Kingdom. . . .

I do not attribute this population to the deposed govern-
ment, because I do not like to compliment the contrivances
of men on what is due largely to the bounty of Providence.
But that decried government could not have obstructed, and
most probably it favoured, the operation of the causes—
whether of nature in the soil or habits of industry among the
people—that has produced such a large number of people
throughout that whole kingdom and exhibited such prodigies
of population in some places. I will never suppose to be the
worst of all political institutions the fabric of a state which is
found by experience to contain a principle that is favourable
(however latent it may be) to the increase of mankind.

National wealth

The wealth of a country is another non-negligible standard
by which we may judge whether a government is, on the
whole, protecting or destructive. France far exceeds England
in the size of its population, but I fear that her comparative
wealth is much inferior to ours, not as evenly distributed as
ours, and not as ready in the circulation. I believe that the
difference in the form of the two governments is one cause
of this advantage on the side of England. . . . But wealth
that will not stand comparison with the riches of England
may ·nevertheless· constitute a very respectable degree of
afﬂuence. M. Necker’s book ·on ﬁnancial administration
in France·, published in 1785, contains an accurate and
interesting collection of facts concerning public economy
and political arithmetic; and his thoughts on the subject are
in general wise and liberal. In that work he gives an idea of
the state of France very remote from the portrait of a country
whose government was a perfect grievance, an absolute evil,
admitting no cure but through the violent and uncertain
remedy of a total revolution. He afﬁrms that between 1726
and 1784 the French mint coined gold and silver to the
amount of about £100,000,000 sterling.

M. Necker couldn’t be mistaken about the amount of
bullion coined in the mint. It is a matter of ofﬁcial record.
This able ﬁnancier’s reasonings concerning the quantity of
gold and silver that remained for circulation when he wrote
in 1785—i.e. about four years before the deposition and
imprisonment of the French king—are not equally certain,
but his grounds for them are so apparently solid that it is not
easy to refuse a considerable degree of assent to his calcula-
tion. He calculates the coin money then actually existing in
France at about £88,000,000 sterling. A great accumulation
of wealth for one country, large as that country is! M. Necker

71

Reﬂections on the Revolution in France

Edmund Burke

Part 2

was so far from considering this inﬂux of wealth as likely
to cease, when he wrote in 1785, that he expected a future
annual increase of 2% on the money brought into France
during the periods from which he computed.

Some cause must have originally introduced all the money
coined at its mint into that kingdom, and some equally
operative cause must have kept at home, or returned into its
bosom, such a vast ﬂood of treasure as M. Necker calculates
to remain for domestic circulation. Make any reasonable
deductions from M. Necker’s computation and the remainder
must still amount to an immense sum. Causes with that
much power to acquire and to retain cannot be found in
discouraged industry, insecure property, and a positively
destructive government. Indeed,
—when I consider the face of the kingdom of France, •the
number and afﬂuence of her cities, •the useful magniﬁcence
of her spacious high roads and bridges, •the opportunity
of her artiﬁcial canals and navigations opening the con-
veniences of maritime communication through such an
immense solid continent;
—when I turn my eyes to •the stupendous works of her ports
and harbours, and to •her whole naval apparatus, whether
for war or trade;
—when I bring before my view the number of her fortiﬁcations,
designed with such bold and masterly skill and built and
maintained at such a prodigious expense, presenting an
armed front and impenetrable barrier to her enemies on
every side;
—when I recollect •how very small a part of that extensive re-
gion is without cultivation, and •to what complete perfection
the culture of many of the best productions of the earth have
been brought in France;
—when I reﬂect on the excellence of her manufactures and

fabrics, second to none but ours, and in some particulars
not second;
—when I contemplate the grand foundations of charity, public
and private;
—when I survey the state of all the arts that beautify and
polish life;
—when I reckon •the men she has bred for extending her
fame in war, •her able statesmen, •the multitude of her
profound lawyers and theologians, •her philosophers, •her
critics, •her historians and antiquaries, •her poets and •her
orators, sacred and profane
—I behold in all this something that awes and commands the
imagination, checks the mind on the brink of precipitate and
indiscriminate censure, and demands that we should very
seriously examine what and how great are the latent vices
that could authorise us at once to pull such a vast structure
to the ground.
I do not recognise in this view of things
the despotism of Turkey. Nor do I discern the character
of a government that has on the whole been so oppressive,
corrupt or negligent as to be utterly unﬁt for all reformation.
I must think such a government well deserved to have its
excellence heightened, its faults corrected, and its capacities
improved into a British constitution.

Anyone who examine the proceedings of that deposed gov-
ernment for several years back cannot fail to observe, amidst
the inconstancy and ﬂuctuation natural to ·royal· courts, an
earnest endeavour toward the prosperity and improvement
of the country; he must admit that this endeavour had long
been directed

•in some instances wholly to remove,
•in many instances considerably to correct

the abusive practices and usages that had prevailed in the
state; and that even the unlimited power of the sovereign over

72

Part 2

the persons of his subjects—inconsistent as it undoubtedly
was with law and liberty—had been every day exercised
more and more lightly. So far from refusing to reform, that
government was open—somewhat too easily open—to all
sorts of projects and projectors on the subject. Rather too
much of a hearing was given to the spirit of innovation, which
was soon turned against those who fostered it and ended in
their ruin. To do justice to that fallen monarchy—a cold and
unﬂattering justice—we should say that for many years it
trespassed more by levity [see Glossary] and lack of judgment
in many of its schemes than from any defect in diligence
or in public spirit. To compare the government of France
for the last ﬁfteen years with wise and well-constituted
establishments during that period (or during any other) is
not fair. But if it is compared with any of the former reigns
·in France· on the matter of extravagance with money or
strictness in the exercise of power, I believe that candid
judges will give little credit to the good intentions of those
who dwell perpetually on the donations to favourites, or on
the expenses of the court, or on the horrors of the Bastille in
the reign of Louis XVI.

It is very doubtful that the system (if it deserves to be
called a ‘system’) now built on the ruins of that ancient
monarchy will be able to give a better account of the pop-
ulation and wealth of the country that it has taken under
its care.
Instead of improving by the change, I fear that
many years must elapse before it can recover to any extent
·from· the effects of this philosophic revolution, and before
the nation can be replaced on its former footing. . . . I hear
that there are considerable emigrations from France, and
that many people, leaving that voluptuous climate and that
seductive ‘liberty’, have taken refuge in Canada—in frozen
territory under British despotism.

With the present disappearance of coin, no-one could

think France the same country as the one in which the
present minister of the ﬁnances was able to ﬁnd £80,000,000
in coinage. From its general aspect one would conclude
that it had for some time been under the special direction
of the learned academicians of Laputa and Balnibarbi [two
ﬁctional realms appallingly governed by philosophers and scientists, in
Swift’s Gulliver’s Travels]. Already the population of Paris has
so declined that M. Necker told the National Assembly that
the provision needed for its subsistence is 20% less than
what had formerly been found to be required. It is said (and
I have never heard it contradicted) that 100,000 people are
unemployed in that city, although it has become the seat of
the imprisoned court and National Assembly. Nothing, I am
credibly informed, can exceed the shocking and disgusting
spectacle of begging displayed in that capital. Indeed the
votes of the National Assembly leave no doubt of the fact.
They have lately appointed a standing committee to deal with
begging.

They are contriving at once a vigorous policy on this
subject and, for the ﬁrst time, the imposition of a tax to
maintain the poor, for whose present relief great sums
appear in the public accounts of the year. In the meantime
the leaders of the legislative clubs and coffee-houses are
intoxicated with admiration at their own wisdom and ability.
They speak with lordly contempt of the rest of the world.
They tell the people, to comfort them in the rags they have
clothed them in, that they are a nation of philosophers; and
•sometimes by all the arts of quackish parade, by show,
tumult, and bustle,
•sometimes by the alarms of plots and invasions,

they try to drown the cries of poverty and to divert the eyes
of the observer from the ruin and wretchedness of the state.
A brave people will certainly prefer •liberty accompanied by
virtuous poverty to •depraved and wealthy servitude. But

73

before the price of comfort and afﬂuence is paid, one ought
to be pretty sure that what one is buying is real liberty, and
that it is to be purchased at no other price. But I shall always
look suspiciously at any ‘liberty’ that does not have wisdom
and justice for its companions and does not bring prosperity.

What is wrong with the French nobility?

The advocates for this Revolution, not satisﬁed with exagger-
ating the vices of their ancient government, strike at the fame
of their country itself by painting almost all that could have
attracted the attention of strangers, namely their nobility
and their clergy, as objects of horror. If this were only a libel,
it would not have mattered much.
—If your nobility and gentry, who constituted most of your
landed men and the whole of your military ofﬁcers, resembled
those of Germany at the time when merchant cities had to
confederate ·as the Hanseatic League· against the nobles in
defence of their property;
—had they been like the Orsini and Vitelli in Italy, who used
to conduct raids from their fortiﬁed dens to rob the trader
and traveller;
—had they been like the Mamelukes in Egypt or the Nayres
on the coast of Malabar,
I do admit that too critical an inquiry might not be advisable
into the means of freeing the world from such a nuisance.
The statues of Equity and Mercy might be veiled for a
moment. The tenderest minds, confused by the dreadful
emergency in which morality submits to the suspension of
its own •rules in favour of its own •principles, might turn
aside while fraud and violence were being used to destroy
a pretended nobility that disgraced human nature while
persecuting human beings. The persons who most loathed

blood and treason and arbitrary conﬁscation might remain
silent spectators of this civil war between the vices.

But did the privileged nobility who met under the king’s
command at Versailles in 1789, or their constituents, deserve
to be looked on as the Nayres or Mamelukes of this age, or
as the Orsini and Vitelli of earlier times? If I had asked the
question then I would have been taken to be a madman.
What have they done since then that they were to be driven
into exile, their persons hunted down, mangled, and tortured,
their families dispersed, their houses laid in ashes, and
their order abolished and the memory of it, if possible,
extinguished by ordering them to change the very names
they were usually known by? Read their instructions to
their representatives. They breathe the spirit of liberty as
warmly and they recommend reformation as strongly as any
other order. Their privileges relative to contribution were
voluntarily surrendered, just as the king from the beginning
surrendered all claims to a right of taxation. There was only
one opinion in France regarding a free constitution. The ab-
solute monarchy was at an end. It breathed its last without a
groan, without struggle, without convulsion. All the struggle
and dissension arose afterwards, with the preference for a
despotic democracy rather than a government of reciprocal
control. The triumph of the victorious party was over the
principles of a British constitution.

I have observed the affectation which for many years has
prevailed in Paris, to a perfectly childish degree, of idolising
the memory of your Henry IV. If anything could put one
out of humour with that ornament to the kingly character,
it would be this overdone style of crafty panegyric. The
persons who have worked this engine the most busily are
those who have ended their panegyrics by dethroning his
successor and descendant, a man at least as good-natured as
Henry IV, altogether as fond of his people, who did inﬁnitely

74

Reﬂections on the Revolution in France

Edmund Burke

Part 2

more to correct the previous vices of the state than that
great monarch did or ever meant to do.
It is as well for
his panegyrists that they don’t have him to deal with. For
Henry IV was a resolute, active, and politic prince. He did
indeed have great humanity and mildness, but these never
stood in the way of his interests. He never sought to be
loved without making himself feared. He used soft language
with determined conduct. He asserted and maintained his
authority on the large scale, and distributed his acts of
concession only in the details. He spent the income of his
prerogative nobly, but he took care not to break in upon the
capital; he never abandoned for a moment any of the claims
that he made under the fundamental laws; he was willing
to shed the blood of those who opposed him, often on the
battle-ﬁeld, sometimes on the scaffold. Because he knew
how to make his virtues respected by the ungrateful, he has
earned the praises of people whom, if they had lived at his
time, he would have shut up in the Bastille and brought to
punishment along with the regicides whom he hanged after
he had starved Paris into surrendering.

If these panegyrists are in earnest in their admiration of
Henry IV, they must remember that they cannot think more
highly of him than he did of the French nobility, whose virtue,
honour, courage, patriotism, and loyalty were his constant
theme.

But the nobility of France are ·said to have· degenerated
since the days of Henry the Fourth. This is possible, but
I cannot think there is much truth in it. I do not claim to
know France as correctly as some others, but I have tried
throughout my life to acquaint myself with human nature,
otherwise I would be unﬁt to take even my humble part in the
service of mankind. In that study I could not ignore a vast
portion of human nature in the form in which it appeared
in a country only twenty-four miles from the English shore.

On my best observation, set alongside my best inquiries, I
found your nobility to be mostly composed of men of high
spirit and of a delicate sense of honour, both with regard
to themselves individually and with regard to their whole
corps, over whom they kept a censorial eye—beyond what
is common in other countries. They were tolerably well
bred, very ofﬁcious [= ‘active in doing their duty’], humane, and
hospitable; in their conversation frank and open; with a
good military tone, and reasonably tinctured with literature,
particularly of the authors in their own language. I speak
of those who were generally met with; many had claims far
above this description.

As to their behaviour to the lower classes, they seemed
to me to comport themselves toward them with good nature
and with something nearer to familiarity than is generally
practised with us in the intercourse between the higher and
lower ranks of life. To strike any person, even one in the
most abject condition, was unknown and would be highly
disgraceful. Instances of other ill-treatment of the humble
part of the community were rare; and as for attacks made on
the property or the personal liberty of the commons, I never
heard of their doing any such thing; and, while the laws
were in force under the former government, such tyranny in
subjects would not have been permitted. As for men with
landed estates, I had no fault to ﬁnd with their conduct,
though much to disapprove of and much to wish changed in
many of the old tenures. Where the letting of their land was
by rent, I could not discover that their agreements with their
farmers were oppressive; and when they were in partnership
with the farmer, as they often were, I have not heard of
their taking the lion’s share. The proportions seemed fair
enough. There might be exceptions, but that is what they
were—exceptions. I have no reason to believe that in these
respects the landed noblesse of France were worse than the

75

Reﬂections on the Revolution in France

Edmund Burke

Part 2

landed gentry of this country, certainly in no way worse than
the non-noble landholders of their own nation. In cities the
nobility had no power, in the country very little. . . .

I am quite entitled to deny that the nobility had any
considerable share in the oppression of the people in cases
where there was real oppression, but I admit that they were
guilty of considerable faults and errors. A foolish imitation
of the worst part of the manners of England, which impaired
their natural character without replacing it by what they may
have meant to copy, has certainly made them worse than
they were. Habitual dissoluteness of manners, continued
beyond the age at which it can be pardoned, was more
common among them than it is with us; and it reigned with
less hope of remedy ·than there is here·, though possibly
less harmfully through being covered with more external
decorum. They gave too ready an ear to the licentious
philosophy that has helped to bring on their ruin. And
there was another more fatal error among them. Commoners
who came to be about as wealthy as many of the nobility
were not fully admitted to the rank and esteem that wealth
ought—in reason and good policy—to confer in every country,
though I think not equally with that of other nobility. The
two kinds of aristocracy—·the wealthy commoners and the
‘other nobility’·—were too punctiliously kept apart, though
not as much so as in Germany and some other nations.

I regard this separation as one principal cause of the
destruction of the old nobility. The military in particular was
too exclusively reserved for men of ·noble· family. But this
was a mere error of opinion, which a conﬂicting opinion
would have rectiﬁed. A permanent assembly in which
the commons had their share of power would soon have
abolished whatever was too divisive and insulting in these
distinctions, and even the faults in the morals of the nobility
would probably have been corrected by the greater varieties

of occupation and activity to which a constitution by orders
[i.e. a system of government equally involving the clergy, and the nobility
and the common people] would have given rise.

All this violent cry against the nobility I take to be a mere
work of art. To be honoured and even privileged by the
laws, opinions, and age-old usages of our country, growing
out of the prejudice of centuries, has nothing to provoke
horror and indignation in any man. Even holding on to
those privileges too tenaciously is not absolutely a crime.
Every man’s strong struggle to keep possession of what
belongs to him and distinguishes him is one of the securities
against injustice and despotism implanted in our nature. It
operates as an instinct to secure property and to preserve
communities in a settled state. What is there to shock in
this? Nobility is a graceful ornament to the civil order. It
is the Corinthian capital of polished society.
‘All we who
are good citizens favour noble birth’ was the saying of a
wise and good man [Cicero; Burke quotes him in Latin]. Indeed
one sign of a liberal and benevolent mind is a slight bias
in favour of nobility. Someone who wishes to level all the
institutions that have been created to give a body to opinion
and to give permanence to ﬂeeting esteem is someone who
feels no ennobling principle in his own heart. It is a sour,
malignant, envious disposition, without taste for virtue or
for any image or representation of it, that sees with joy the
undeserved fall of what had long ﬂourished in splendour and
in honour. I do not like to see anything destroyed, any void
produced in society, any ruin on the face of the land. So
I was not disappointed that my inquiries and observations
did not present to me any incorrigible vices in the nobility
of France, or any abuse that could not be removed by a
reform much less drastic than abolition. Your noblesse did
not deserve punishment; and degrading is punishing.

What is wrong with the French clergy?

It was with the same satisfaction that I found that the result
of my inquiry concerning your clergy was not dissimilar. It
is no soothing news to my ears that great bodies of men are
incurably corrupt. I listen sceptically to people who speak
evil of those whom they are going to plunder. I suspect that
vices are invented or exaggerated when proﬁt is expected
from their punishment. An enemy is a bad witness; a robber
is a worse. There undoubtedly were vices and abuses in the
clergy. That was inevitable: it was an old establishment, and
not frequently revised. But I saw no crimes in the individuals
that merited conﬁscation of their substance, or the cruel
insults and degradations and the unnatural persecution that
have been substituted for regulation to make things better.
If there had been any just cause for this new religious
persecution, the atheistic libellers who act as trumpeters to
animate the populace to plunder would have trumpeted the
vices of today’s clergy. This they have not done. They ﬁnd
themselves obliged to rake into the histories of former ages
(which they have ransacked with a malignant and proﬂigate
industry) for every instance of oppression and persecution
that has been made by or on behalf of the clergy, in order
to justify. . . .their own persecutions and cruelties. After
destroying all other genealogies and family distinctions, they
invent a sort of pedigree of crimes. To

•chastise men for the offences of their natural ances-
tors

is not very just; but to

•take the ﬁction of ancestry in a corporate succession
as reason for punishing men who have no relation to
guilty acts except in names and general descriptions
is a sort of reﬁnement in injustice belonging to the phi-
losophy of this ‘enlightened’ age. The Assembly punishes

men of whom many, perhaps most, hate the violent conduct
of ecclesiastics in earlier times as much as their present
persecutors can do, and who would be as loud and as strong
in expressing their disapproval if they were not well aware of
the purposes for which all this declamation is employed.

Corporate bodies are immortal for the •good of the mem-
bers, but not for their •punishment. Nations themselves
are such corporations. It’s as though we in England waged
endless war on all Frenchmen for the evils that they brought
on us in the various periods of our mutual hostilities. Or as
though you thought yourselves justiﬁed in falling upon all
Englishmen because of the unparalleled calamities brought
on the people of France by the unjust invasions of our Henrys
and our Edwards. Indeed, we would be mutually justiﬁed
in this exterminatory war on each other, as much as you
are justiﬁed in the unprovoked persecution of your present
countrymen because of the conduct of men of the same name
in other times.

What we can learn from history

We do not draw the moral lessons we could from history.
On the contrary, without care it may be used to vitiate our
minds and to destroy our happiness.
In history a great
volume is unrolled for our instruction, drawing the materials
of future wisdom from the past errors and inﬁrmities of
mankind. If it is perverted it can serve as a warehouse full
of offensive and defensive weapons for parties in church
and state, supplying the means of keeping alive or reviving
dissensions and animosities and adding fuel to civil fury.
History consists for the greater part of the miseries brought
on the world by pride, ambition, avarice, revenge, lust,
sedition, hypocrisy, ungoverned zeal, and all the train of
disorderly appetites which shake the public with the same

77

— troublous storms that toss

The private state, and render life unsweet.
[Spenser, Faery Queene]

These vices are the causes of those storms. Religion,
morals, laws, prerogatives, privileges, liberties, rights of men
are the excuses for them. The excuses are always found in
some specious appearance of a real good. You would not
secure men from tyranny and sedition by rooting out of the
mind the principles to which these fraudulent excuses apply?
If you did, you would root out everything that is valuable in
the human breast. And the usual actors and instruments
in great public evils are kings, priests, magistrates, senates,
parliaments, national assemblies, judges, and captains; but
you would not cure the evil by deciding not to have any more
monarchs, ministers of state or of the gospel, interpreters of
law, general ofﬁcers, public councils. You might change the
names. The things in some shape must remain. A certain
quantum of power must always exist in the community in
some hands and under some label. Wise men apply their
remedies to vices, not to names; to the causes of evil that
are permanent, not to the occasional organs by which they
act and the transitory forms that they take. Otherwise you
will be wise historically, a fool in practice. It does not often
happen that two ages have the same fashion in their excuses
and the same ways of doing harm. Wickedness is a little more
inventive! While you are discussing fashion, the fashion
changes. The very same vice assumes a new body. The spirit
transmigrates, and far from losing its energy by the change
of its appearance it is renovated in its new organs with fresh
vigour. . . . It walks abroad, it continues its ravages, while you
are hanging out the carcass to rot or demolishing the tomb.
You are terrifying yourselves with ghosts and apparitions,
while your house is the haunt of robbers. That is how it is

with all those who, attending only to the shell and husk of
history, think they are waging war with intolerance, pride,
and cruelty, while under pretext of hating the bad principles
of antiquated parties they are authorising and feeding the
same odious vices in different factions that may be even
worse.

Your citizens of Paris in 1572 let themselves be willing
instruments to slaughter the followers of Calvin in the
infamous massacre of St. Bartholomew. What should we
say to anyone who thought of retaliating against today’s
Parisians for the abominations and horrors of that time?
They are indeed brought to abhor that massacre. Ferocious
as they are, it is not difﬁcult to make them dislike it, because
the politicians and fashionable teachers have no interest in
giving their passions exactly the same direction. Still, they
ﬁnd it their interest to keep the same savage dispositions
alive ·in the populace·. [He reports on a recent enactment of
that massacre on a stage in Paris, showing ‘the cardinal of
Lorraine ordering general slaughter’. Then:] Not long after
this exhibition,. . . .the archbishop of Paris—whose function
was known to his people only by his prayers and benedic-
tions, and his wealth only by his alms—is forced to abandon
his house and to ﬂy from his ﬂock as from ravenous wolves,
because in the 16th century the cardinal of Lorraine was a
rebel and a murderer.

Such is the effect of the perversion of history by those
who have, for the same nefarious purposes, perverted every
other branch of learning. But those whose view of history
highlights. . . .the spirit and moral quality of human actions
will say to the teachers of the Palais Royal: ‘The cardinal of
Lorraine was the murderer of the 16th century, you have
the glory of being the murderers in the 18th, and this is
the only difference between you.’ But I hope that history in
the 19th century, better understood and better employed,

78

Reﬂections on the Revolution in France

Edmund Burke

Part 2

will teach a civilised posterity to abhor the misdeeds of
both these barbarous ages.
It will teach future priests
and magistrates not to retaliate against the theoretical and
inactive atheists of future times for the enormities committed
by the present practical zealots and furious fanatics of that
wretched error. . . . It will teach posterity not to make war
on either religion or philosophy for the abuse that the hyp-
ocrites of both have made of the two most valuable blessings
conferred on us by God. . . .

Again: how bad were the French clergy?

If any clergy should show themselves to be vicious beyond
the fair bounds allowed to •human inﬁrmity and to •the
professional faults that can hardly be separated from pro-
fessional virtues,. . . .they would naturally have the effect of
greatly reducing our indignation against the tyrants who
exceed measure and justice in their punishment.
I can
allow in clergymen, through all their divisions, some tenacity
about their own opinion, some overﬂowings of zeal for its
propagation, some bias in favour of their own state and ofﬁce,
some attachment to the interests of their own corps, some
tendency to prefer •those who listen with docility to their
doctrines to •those who scorn and deride them. I allow all
this because I am a man who has to deal with men, and
who would not, through a violence of toleration, run into the
greatest of all intolerance. I must put up with inﬁrmities
until they fester into crimes.

Undoubtedly, the natural progress of the passions, from
frailty to vice, ought to be prevented by a watchful eye and
a ﬁrm hand. But is it true that the body of your clergy had
passed those limits of a just allowance? From the general
style of your late publications of all sorts one would be led to
believe that your clergy in France were a sort of monsters, a

horrible composition of superstition, ignorance, sloth, fraud,
avarice, and tyranny. But is this true? Is it true that

the lapse of time,
•the cessation of conﬂicting interests,
•the sad experience of the evils caused by party rage
have not tended gradually to improve their minds? Is it true
that they were daily renewing invasions on the civil power,
troubling the domestic quiet of their country, and making
the operations of its government feeble and precarious? Is it
true that the clergy of our times have pressed down the laity
with an iron hand and were everywhere lighting the ﬁres of
savage persecution? Did they try by every fraud to increase
their estates?. . . . When not possessed of power, were they
ﬁlled with the vices of those who envy it? Were they inﬂamed
with a violent, litigious spirit of controversy? Spurred on by
an ambition for intellectual sovereignty, were they ready to
ﬂy in the face of all magistracy, to ﬁre churches, to massacre
the priests of other kinds, to pull down altars, and to make
their way over the ruins of subverted governments to an
empire of doctrine. . . .forcing the consciences of men from
the jurisdiction of public institutions into submitting to their
personal authority, beginning with a claim of liberty and
ending with an abuse of power?

These, or some of these, were the vices charged against
several of the churchmen of former times who belonged to
the two great parties—catholics and protestants—which then
divided and distracted Europe. The charges were not wholly
without foundation.

If there was in France, as in other countries there visibly
is, a great lessening rather than any increase of these vices,
the present clergy ought in common fairness to be praised,
encouraged, and supported in their departure from a spirit
that disgraced their predecessors, and for having assumed
a frame of mind and conduct more suitable to their sacred

79

Part 2

function—not loaded with the crimes of other men and the
odious character of other times.

When my affairs took me into France toward the close
of the late reign, the clergy in all their forms engaged a
considerable part of my curiosity. So far from ﬁnding (except
from one set of men, not then very numerous, though very
active) the complaints and discontents against them that
some publications had given me reason to expect, I found
little or no public or private uneasiness on their account.
On further examination I found the clergy in general to be
persons of moderate minds and decorous manners. . . . I did
not have the good fortune to know many of the parochial
clergy, but in general I received a perfectly good account of
their morals and attention to their duties. I had a personal
acquaintance with some of the higher clergy, and very good
means of information concerning the rest. Almost all of
them were persons of noble birth. They resembled others
of their own rank; and where there was any difference it
was in their favour. They were more fully educated than
the military noblesse, so as not to disgrace their profession
by ignorance or lack of ﬁtness for the exercise of their
authority. They struck me as liberal and open, with the
hearts of gentlemen and men of honour, neither insolent
nor servile in their manners and conduct. They seemed
to me rather a superior class, a set of men among whom
you would not be surprised to ﬁnd a Fénelon. I saw among
the clergy in Paris. . . .men of great learning and candour;
and I had reason to believe that this description was not
conﬁned to Paris. What I found in other places I know was
accidental, and therefore to be presumed a fair example.
I spent a few days in a provincial town where, in the absence
of the bishop, I passed my evenings with three clergymen,
his vicars-general, persons who would have done honour
to any church. They were all well informed; two of them of

deep, general, and extensive erudition, ancient and modern,
oriental and western, particularly in their own profession.
They had a more extensive knowledge of our English divines
than I expected, and they entered into the genius of those
writers with a critical accuracy. One of these gentlemen is
since dead, the Abbé Morangis. I pay this tribute, without
reluctance, to the memory of that noble, reverend, learned,
and excellent person; and I would do the same with equal
cheerfulness to the merits of the others who I believe are still
living, if I did not fear to hurt those whom I am unable to
serve. . . .

Before your Revolution you had about 120 bishops. A few
of them were men of eminent sanctity, and charity without
limit. . . . I believe the instances of eminent depravity may
be as rare among them as those of transcendent goodness.
Examples of avarice and of licentiousness can be found—I do
not question it—by those who delight in looking for such
discoveries. A man as old as I am will not be astonished that
several, in every description [see Glossary], do not lead the life
of perfect self-denial with regard to wealth or to pleasure
that is

•wished for by all,
•expected by some, and
•demanded with most rigour by those who are the most
attentive to their own interests, or the most indulgent
to their own passions.

When I was in France, I am certain that the number of
vicious prelates was not great. Some of them who were
not noteworthy for the regularity of their lives made some
amends for their lack of the •severe virtues by their posses-
sion of the •liberal ones, and had personal qualities that
made them useful in the church and state. I am told that in
his promotions to the rank of prelate Louis XVI had usually
been more attentive to character than Louis XV; and I believe

80

this may be true, because some spirit of reform prevailed
through the whole reign. But the present ruling power has
shown a disposition only to plunder the church. [He goes
on at length: the clergy will now be paid only what the state
pays them, a pittance; no ‘science or erudition’ can now come
from the church in France; clergymen will now be elected,
which will bring ‘licentious, bold, crafty, factious, ﬂattering
wretches’ into their ranks; and so on.]

Abolishing Christianity

In short, Sir, it seems to me that this new ecclesiastical
establishment is intended only to be temporary and prepara-
tory to the utter abolition of every form of the Christian
religion, as soon as the minds of men are prepared for this
last stroke against it—through a plan to bring its ministers
into universal contempt. Those who refuse to believe that
the philosophical fanatics who guide in these matters have
long had such a scheme in mind are utterly ignorant of
their character and proceedings. These zealots do not
scruple to express their opinion that a state can subsist
without any religion better than with one, and that they
can make up for any good there may be in religion by a
project of their own—namely, by a sort of education they
have imagined, based on knowledge of the physical wants
of men, progressively carried to an enlightened self-interest
which, when well understood, will (they tell us) coincide with
the public interest. . . .

I hope their partisans in England (to whom I attribute
thoughtlessness rather than support for this detestable
design) will not succeed in the pillage of the ecclesiastics
or in the introduction of a system of popular election to
our bishoprics and parochial curacies. This, in the present
condition of the world, would be the last corruption of the

church, the utter ruin of the clerical character, the most
dangerous shock that the state ever received through a
misunderstood arrangement of religion. I know well enough
that the bishoprics and curacies under kingly and seignioral
patronage, as they are now in England and were recently in
France, are sometimes acquired by unworthy methods; but
popular election subjects them much more surely and more
generally to all the evil arts of low ambition, which, operating
on and through greater numbers, will be proportionately
more harmful.

Those of you who have robbed the clergy think they
will easily reconcile their conduct to all Protestant nations,
because the clergy they have thus plundered, degraded, and
given over to mockery and scorn are Roman Catholics. I have
no doubt that here and elsewhere some miserable bigots will
be found who hate sects and parties different from their
own more than they love the substance of religion, and who
are more angry with those who differ from them in their
particular plans and systems than displeased with those
who attack the foundation of our common hope. These men
will write and speak on the subject in the manner that is to
be expected from their temperament and character. Burnet
says that when he was in France in 1683 ‘the method that
brought the ablest men to Popery was this: they brought
themselves to doubt the whole Christian religion. Once that
was done, it seemed not to matter which form of religion
they continued outwardly.’ If this was then the ecclesiastical
policy of France, they have since had all too much reason to
repent of it. They preferred atheism to a form of religion not
agreeable to their ideas. They succeeded in destroying that
form; and atheism has succeeded in destroying them. . . .

The teachers who reformed our religion in England bore
no sort of resemblance to your present reforming doctors
in Paris. Perhaps they were (like those whom they opposed)

81

rather more under the inﬂuence of a party spirit than could
be wished, but they were sincere believers, men of the most
fervent and exalted piety, ready to die (as some of them did
die) like true heroes in defence of their particular ideas of
Christianity, just as they would with equal fortitude and
more cheerfully have died for the stock of general truth
for the branches of which they contended with their blood.
[That is, they were ready to die to protestantism, and even more ready
to die for Christianity.] These men would have disavowed with
horror the wretches who claimed a fellowship with them
simply because they had pillaged the persons with whom
they maintained controversies. . . . Many of their descendants
have kept the same zeal, but (as less engaged in conﬂict)
with more moderation. They do not forget that justice and
mercy are substantial parts of religion. Impious men do not
recommend themselves to their communion by iniquity and
cruelty toward any description of their fellow creatures.

Two kinds of tolerance

We hear these new teachers continually boasting of their
spirit of toleration. There is not much merit in tolerating
all opinions if you don’t think highly of any of them. Equal
neglect is not impartial kindness. The kind of benevolence
that arises from contempt is no true charity. There are in
England plenty of men who tolerate in the true spirit of tol-
eration. They think the dogmas of religion are all important,
though in different degrees, and that among them there is,
as with all things of value, a sound reason for preferring
some to others. They favour, therefore, and they tolerate.
They tolerate not because they despise opinions but because
they respect justice. They would reverently and affectionately
protect all religions because they love and venerate the great
principle on which they all agree, and the great objective

to which they are all directed. They begin to see more and
more clearly that we have all a common cause, as against a
common enemy. They will not be so misled by the spirit of
faction as not to distinguish •what is done in favour of their
subdivision [protestantism] from •the acts of hostility which,
through some particular description, are aimed at the whole
corps [Christianity] in which they themselves are included. It is
impossible for me to say what may be the character of every
description of men among us. But I speak for the greater
part; and for them I must tell you that sacrilege is no part
of their doctrine of good works; that, so far from calling you
into their fellowship on such a basis, your professors will
not be admitted to their communion unless they carefully
conceal their doctrine of the lawfulness of the condemnation
of innocent men, and make restitution of all stolen goods
whatsoever. Till then they are none of ours.

Conﬁscation again

You may suppose that we disapprove of your conﬁscation
of the revenues of bishops, and deans, and chapters, and
parochial clergy possessing independent estates arising from
land, because we have the same sort of establishment in
England. That objection (you will say) cannot hold regarding
the conﬁscation of the goods of monks and nuns and the
abolition of their order. It is true that this particular part
of your general conﬁscation does not affect England; but
the reason ·for objecting to it· applies ·here too·, and it goes
a great way. The Long Parliament conﬁscated the lands of
deans and chapters in England on the basis of the same
ideas on which your Assembly arranged to sell the lands
of the monastic orders. But what is objectionable is the
principle of injustice, not the description of persons on whom
it is ﬁrst exercised. I see being pursued in a country very

82

Reﬂections on the Revolution in France

Edmund Burke

Part 2

near us a course of policy that deﬁes justice, the common
concern of all mankind. With the National Assembly of
France possession is nothing, law and usage are nothing. I
see the National Assembly openly condemning the doctrine
of prescription [see Glossary], which one of the greatest of their
own lawyers rightly tells us is a part of the law of nature.
He tells us that the positive settling of its limits, and its
security from invasion, were among the causes for which
civil society itself was instituted.
If prescription is once
shaken, no kind of property is secure once it becomes large
enough to tempt those who are poor but powerful. I see a
practice perfectly in line with their contempt for this great
fundamental part of natural law. I see the conﬁscators begin
with bishops and chapters, and monasteries, but I do not
see them end there. I see the princes of the blood, who by
the oldest usages of that kingdom held large landed estates,
being •deprived (with almost no debate) of their possessions
and, in place of their stable independent property, •reduced
to the hope of some precarious, charitable pension at the
pleasure of an assembly which will not pay much regard to
the rights of pensioners-at-pleasure when it despises those
of legal proprietors. Flushed with the insolence of their ﬁrst
inglorious victories, and pressed by the distresses caused
by their greed, disappointed but not discouraged, they have
at length ventured completely to subvert all property of all
descriptions throughout the extent of a great kingdom. They
have compelled all men, in all transactions of commerce,
in the disposal of lands, in civil dealing, and through the
whole communion of life, to accept as perfect payment
and good and lawful tender the ·paper money, which is
a mere· symbol of their speculations on a proposed sale
of their plunder. What vestiges of liberty or property have
they left? The tenant right of a cabbage garden, a year’s
interest in a hovel, the goodwill of an alehouse or a baker’s

shop, the very shadow of a constructive property, are more
ceremoniously treated in our parliament than you treat •the
oldest and most valuable landed possessions in the hands
of the most respectable personages, or •the whole body of
the moneyed and commercial interest of your country. We
have a high opinion of the legislative authority, but we have
never dreamed that parliaments had any right whatever
to violate property, to overrule prescription, or to force a
currency of their own ﬁction in the place of that which is
real and recognised by the law of nations. But you, who
began by refusing to submit to the most moderate restraints,
have ended by establishing an unheard-of despotism. Your
conﬁscators evidently hold that indeed their proceedings
could not be supported in a court of justice, but that the
rules of prescription cannot bind a legislative assembly. So
this legislative assembly of a free nation sits not for the
security of property but for its destruction, and not only of
property but of every rule and maxim that can give it stability,
and of the only instruments—·legitimate coinage·—that can
give it circulation. . . .

What terriﬁes wisdom most is epidemic fanaticism,
because of all enemies this is the one against which wisdom
is the least able to provide any kind of resource. We cannot be
ignorant of the spirit of atheistic fanaticism that is inspired
by a multitude of writings dispersed with incredible assiduity
and expense, and by sermons delivered in all the streets and
places of public resort in Paris. These writings and sermons
have ﬁlled the populace with a black and savage atrocity
of mind, which supersedes in them the common feelings of
nature as well as all sentiments of morality and religion, to
such an extent that these wretches are induced to bear with
sullen patience the intolerable distresses brought on them
by the violent convulsions and permutations that have been
made in property. The spirit of proselytism accompanies

83

Reﬂections on the Revolution in France

Edmund Burke

Part 2

this spirit of fanaticism. They have societies to plot and
correspond, at home and abroad, for the propagation of their
tenets. The republic of Berne, one of the happiest, most
prosperous, and best governed countries on earth, is one of
the great objects whose destruction they aim at. I am told
they have in some measure succeeded in sowing there the
seeds of discontent. They are busy throughout Germany.
Spain and Italy have not been untried. England is not left
out of the comprehensive scheme of their malignant charity;
and in England we ﬁnd those

•who stretch out their arms to them,
•who recommend their example from more than one
pulpit,
•who choose in more than one periodical meeting
publicly to correspond with them, applaud them, and
hold them up as objects for imitation;
•who receive from them tokens of confraternity, and
standards consecrated in their rites and mysteries;
•who suggest to them leagues of perpetual amity. . .

. . . at the very time when the power to which our constitution
has exclusively delegated the federative [here = ‘international
relations’] capacity of this kingdom may ﬁnd it expedient to
make war on them.

It is not the conﬁscation of our church property from this
example in France that I dread, though I think this would
be a considerable evil. The great source of my anxiety is the
thought that it might come to be considered in England as
the policy of a state to seek a resource in conﬁscations of
any kind, or that any one description of citizens should be
brought to regard any of the others as their proper prey.
Nations are wading deeper and deeper into an ocean of
boundless debt. Public debts, which at ﬁrst were a security
to •governments by giving many people an interest in public
tranquillity, are likely in their excess to become the means

of •their subversion. If governments provide for these debts
by heavy impositions, they perish by becoming odious to the
people. If they do not provide for them, they will be undone
by the efforts of the most dangerous of all parties—I mean an
extensive and discontented moneyed interest that has been
injured but not destroyed. The men who compose this inter-
est look for their security ﬁrst to the government’s •ﬁdelity
and secondly to its •power. If they ﬁnd the old governments
to be effete, worn out, their mainsprings unwound, so as not
to have enough vigour for their purposes, they may seek new
ones that will have more energy; and the source of this energy
will not be the acquisition of resources but a contempt for
justice. Revolutions are favourable to conﬁscation; and it is
impossible to know what obnoxious names the next conﬁsca-
tions will be given. I am sure that the principles predominant
in France extend to very many persons and descriptions
of persons, in all countries, who think their •harmless
indolence to be their security. This kind of •innocence in
proprietors may be argued to be •uselessness; and that
may be argued to be •unﬁtness for their estates. Many
parts of Europe are in open disorder. In many others there
is a hollow underground murmur; a confused movement
is felt that threatens a general earthquake in the political
world. Already confederacies and correspondencies of the
most extraordinary nature are forming in several countries.
In such a state of things we ought to be on our guard. In all
changes (if there must be changes) the thing that will serve
most to blunt the edge of their damage and promote what
good may be in them is for us to keep our minds tenacious
about justice and careful about property.

This may be said: ‘This conﬁscation in France ought not
to alarm other nations. It is not made from wanton rapacity;
it is a great measure of national policy adopted to remove
an extensive, inveterate, superstitious mischief.’ I have the

84

Reﬂections on the Revolution in France

Edmund Burke

Part 2

greatest difﬁculty separating policy from justice. Justice
itself is the great standing policy of civil society, and any
conspicuous departure from it under any circumstances lies
under the suspicion of being no policy at all.

When the existing laws encourage men to go into a certain
way of life and protect them in it as in a lawful occupation;
when they have adjusted all their ideas and habits to it; when
the law had long made their adherence to its rules a ground
of reputation, and their departure from them a ground of
disgrace and even of penalty—I am sure it is unjust for the
legislature by an arbitrary act to offer a sudden violence
to their minds and their feelings, forcibly to degrade them
from their state and condition and to stigmatize with shame
and infamy the character and customs that previously had
been made the measure of their happiness and honour. If to
this is added expulsion from their homes and conﬁscation
of all their goods, I am not clever enough to discover how
this—this despotic sport made of the feelings, consciences,
prejudices, and properties of men—can be distinguished
from the rankest tyranny.

Justice and public beneﬁt

If the injustice of the course pursued in France is clear, the
policy behind it—i.e. the public beneﬁt to be expected from
it—ought to be at least as clear and at least as important. To
a man who acts under the inﬂuence of no passion, who has
nothing in view in his projects but the public good, a great
difference will immediately strike him between

•what policy would dictate on the question of whether
such institutions should be set up in the ﬁrst place

and

•what it would dictate on the question of whether they
should be totally abolished after they have cast their

roots wide and deep, so that by long habit things more
valuable than themselves are so adapted to them—in
a way interwoven with them—that the one cannot be
destroyed without notably impairing the other.

He might be embarrassed if the case were really such as
the logical tricksters represent it in their paltry style of
debating. But in this, as in most questions of state, there is
a middle. There is something other than the mere alternative
of •absolute destruction or •unreformed existence. ‘Sparta
exists; be a credit to it’ [this is from Euripides, but Burke quotes it
in Latin]. This is, in my opinion, a rule of profound sense and
ought never to depart from the mind of an honest reformer.
I cannot conceive how any man can have brought himself
to such a level of presumption as to consider his country as
nothing but carte blanche on which he may scribble whatever
he pleases. A man full of warm, speculative benevolence may
wish his society otherwise constituted than he ﬁnds it, but a
good patriot and a true politician always considers how he
shall make the most of the existing materials of his country.
A disposition to preserve and an ability to improve, taken
together, would be my standard of a statesman. Everything
else is vulgar in the conception and perilous in the execution.
There are moments in the fortune of states when par-
ticular men are called to make improvements by great
mental exertion. In those moments, even when they seem
to have the conﬁdence of their prince and country and
to be invested with full authority, they don’t always have
suitable instruments. A politician, to do great things, looks
for a power—what our workmen call a purchase [something
providing a grip, hand-hold, leverage, or the like]—and in politics as
in mechanics if he ﬁnds that power he cannot be at a loss to
apply it. I think that the monastic institutions were a great
power for the mechanism of political benevolence. There
were revenues with a public direction; there were men

85

Reﬂections on the Revolution in France

Edmund Burke

Part 2

•wholly set apart and dedicated to public purposes,
without any other than public ties and public
principles;
•without the possibility of converting the estate of the
community into a private fortune;
•denied to self-interest, and acquisitive only on behalf
of some community;
•to whom personal poverty is honour, and implicit
obedience stands in the place of freedom.

It is hopeless for a man to try to make such things when
he needs them. The winds blow as they wish. These
institutions are the products of fanaticism; they are the
instruments of wisdom. Wisdom cannot create materials;
they are the gifts of nature or of chance; wisdom’s pride
is in the use. The perennial existence of corporate bodies
and their fortunes are things particularly suited to a man
who has long views; who meditates designs that require
time to develop and that are meant to be long-lasting when
they are accomplished. Someone does not deserve to be
mentioned among the great statesmen if, having obtained
the command and direction of such a power as existed in the
wealth, discipline and habits of corporations like the ones
you have rashly destroyed, cannot ﬁnd any way of converting
it to the great and lasting beneﬁt of his country. A thousand
ways of doing this suggest themselves to a contriving mind.
To destroy any power growing wild from the raw productive
force of the human mind is something in the moral world
that is almost tantamount to destroying the apparently active
properties of bodies in the material world. It would be like
trying to destroy (if we could) the expansive force of ﬁxed air
in nitre, or the power of steam or electricity or magnetism.
These energies always existed in nature, and they were
always detectible. Some of them seemed unserviceable,

some noxious, some no better than a sport for children;
until intellectual ability combined with practical skill tamed
their wild nature, subdued them to use, and made them at
once the most powerful and the most tractable agents in
subservience to the great views and designs of men. Did ﬁfty
thousand persons whose mental and bodily labour you might
direct, and so many hundred thousand a year of revenue
that was neither lazy nor superstitious, appear too big for
your abilities to work with? Had you no way of using them
other than by converting monks into pensioners? Had you
no way of turning the revenue to account except through
the improvident resource of a spendthrift sale? If you were
as destitute as this of mental funds, the proceeding is on
its natural course. Your politicians do not understand their
trade, so they sell their tools.

You may say: ‘But those institutions savour of super-
stition in their very principle, and they nourish it by a
permanent and standing inﬂuence.’ I do not mean to dispute
this, but it ought not to hinder you from deriving from
superstition itself any resources it can provide for the public
advantage. You derive beneﬁts from many dispositions and
many passions of the human mind that are as suspect to
the moral eye as superstition itself. It was your business to
correct and mitigate everything that was noxious in this pas-
sion, as in all the passions. But is superstition the greatest
of all possible vices? In its possible excess I think it becomes
a very great evil. But it is a moral subject and as such
admits of all degrees and all varieties. [Here ‘a moral subject’
means, approximately, ‘a state of people’s minds’]. Superstition is the
religion of feeble minds; and it must be tolerated in them—in
some triﬂing or some fanatical shape or other—for otherwise
you will deprive weak minds of a resource that the strongest
ﬁnd to be necessary. The body of all true religion consists,
to be sure, in obedience to the will of the Sovereign of the

86

Part 2

world, in conﬁdence in his declarations, and in imitation of
his perfections. The rest is our own. What we add may be
prejudicial to the great goal; it may be helpful. Wise men,
who as such are not admirers of the gifts of the earth, are
not violently attached to these things, nor do they violently
hate them. Wisdom is not the most severe corrector of folly.
The most severe correctors are the rival follies that mutually
wage such an unrelenting war; and that make such a cruel
use of their advantages to bring the immoderate vulgar in
on their side in their quarrels. Prudence would be neutral,
but if, in the dispute between •simple-minded attachment
and •ﬁerce antipathy concerning things in their nature not
made to produce such heats, a prudent man had to make a
choice of what errors and excesses of enthusiasm he would
condemn and which he would bear, perhaps he would think
that

•the superstition that builds is more tolerable than the
one that demolishes;
•that which adorns a country . . . than that which
deforms it;
•that which endows. . . than that which plunders;
•that which disposes to mistaken beneﬁcence. . . than
that which stimulates to real injustice;
•that which leads a man to refuse himself lawful plea-
sures. . . than that which snatches from others the
scanty subsistence of their self-denial.

That, I think, is very nearly the state of the question be-
tween the ancient founders of monkish superstition and the
superstition of the self-proclaimed ‘philosophers’ of today.

The estates of monasteries

For the present I postpone consideration of the supposed
public proﬁt of the sale (which I think is perfectly delusive).

I shall consider it here only as a transfer of property. On the
policy of that transfer I shall trouble you with a few thoughts.
In every prosperous community something more is pro-
duced than goes to the immediate support of the producer.
This surplus forms the income of the landed capitalist. It
will be spent by a proprietor who does not labour. But this
idleness is itself the spring of labour, this repose the spur
to industry. The only concern of the state is that the capital
taken in rent from the land should be returned again to the
industry it came from, and that its expenditure should be
with the least possible detriment to the morals of those who
spend it and those of the people to whom it is returned.

In all the views of receipt, expenditure, and personal
employment, a sober legislator would carefully compare the
possessor whom he was recommended to expel with the
stranger who was proposed to ﬁll his place. Before the incon-
veniences are incurred which must accompany all violent
revolutions in property through extensive conﬁscation, we
ought to have some rational assurance that the purchasers
of the conﬁscated property will be

•considerably more laborious, more virtuous, more
sober, less disposed to extort an unreasonable pro-
portion of the gains of the labourer or consume more
than is ﬁt, or
•qualiﬁed to dispense the surplus in a more steady and
equal way so as to satisfy the purposes of a politic
expenditure,

than were the previous owners of the property, whether they
are bishops, canons, commendatory abbots, or monks, or
what you please. ‘The monks are lazy.’ Be it so. Suppose
their only occupation is to sing in the choir. They are as
usefully employed as those who neither sing nor say; as
usefully even as those who sing on the stage. They are
as usefully employed as if they worked from dawn to dark

87

Reﬂections on the Revolution in France

Edmund Burke

Part 2

in the innumerable servile, degrading, unseemly, unmanly,
and often most unwholesome and pestiferous occupations
to which the economic system dooms so many wretches. If it
were not generally pernicious to disturb the natural course
of things and to impede in any degree the great wheel of
circulation which is turned by the strangely-directed labour
of these unhappy people, I would be inﬁnitely more inclined
to •rescue them forcibly from their miserable industry than
to •disturb violently the tranquil repose of monastic quietude.
Humanity, and perhaps policy, might better justify me in
the one than in the other. . . . Anyway, for this purpose
of distribution, it seems to me that the idle expenses of
monks are quite as well directed as the idle expenses of us
lay-loiterers.

When the advantages of the possession and of the project
are on a par, there is no motive for a change. But in
the present case, perhaps, they are not on a par, and the
difference is in favour of the possession. It does not appear to
me that •the expenses of those whom you are going to expel
do in fact take a course as directly and as generally leading
to vitiate and degrade and render miserable those through
whom they pass as do •the expenses of those favourites
whom you are intruding into their houses. Why should the
expenditure of a great landed property, which is a dispersion
of the surplus product of the soil, appear intolerable to you
or to me when it takes its course through

•the accumulation of vast libraries, which are the
history of the force and weakness of the human mind;
•great collections of ancient records, medals, and coins,
which attest and explain laws and customs;
•paintings and statues which, by imitating nature,
seem to extend the limits of creation;
•grand monuments of the dead, which continue the
regards and connections of life beyond the grave;

•collections of the specimens of nature which become a
representative assembly of all the classes and families
of the world that by disposition facilitate and by
arousing curiosity open the avenues to science?

If by great permanent establishments all these objects of
expense are better secured from the inconstant sport of
personal caprice and personal extravagance, are they worse
than if the same tastes prevailed in scattered individuals?
Does not the sweat of the mason and carpenter, who toil
in order to partake of the sweat of the peasant, ﬂow as
pleasantly and as salubriously in the construction and
repair of the majestic ediﬁces of religion as in the painted
booths and sordid sties of vice and luxury; as honourably
and proﬁtably in repairing sacred works that grow hoary
with innumerable years as on the momentary receptacles of
transient voluptuousness; on opera houses, and brothels,
and gaming houses, and clubhouses, and obelisks in the
Champ de Mars? Is the surplus product of the olive and the
vine worse employed •in the frugal sustenance of persons
whom the ﬁctions of a pious imagination raise to dignity
by construing what they do as the service of God than •in
pampering the innumerable multitude of those who are
degraded by being made useless domestics, subservient
to the pride of man? Are the decorations of temples an
expenditure less worthy in the eyes of a wise man than
ribbons, and laces, and national cockades, and. . . .all the
innumerable fopperies and follies in which afﬂuence sports
away the burden of its superﬂuity?

We tolerate these not from love of them but for fear of
worse. We tolerate them because property and liberty up
to a point require that toleration. But why proscribe the
other use of estates—the one that is surely in every way
more laudable? Why, through the violation of all property,
through an outrage on every principle of liberty, forcibly

88

Reﬂections on the Revolution in France

Edmund Burke

Part 2

carry them from the better to the worse?

This comparison between the new individuals and the
old corps is made on a supposition that no reform could
be made in the latter. But in a question of reformation I
always consider corporate bodies, whether sole or consisting
of many, to be much more susceptible of a public direction
by the power of the state, in the use of their property and in
the regulation of habits of life in their members, than private
citizens ever can be or perhaps ought to be; and this seems
to me an important consideration for those who undertake
anything that merits the name of a ‘political enterprise’. —So
much for the estates of monasteries.

The church’s landed estates

With regard to the estates possessed by bishops and canons
and commendatory abbots, I cannot discover any reason
why some landed estates may not be held on some basis
other than by inheritance. Can any philosophical spoiler
undertake to demonstrate the absolute or comparative evil of
having a large portion of landed property passing
in succession through persons whose entitlement to
it is—always in theory and often in fact—a notable
degree of piety, morals, and learning; a property
which. . . .gives to the noblest families renovation and
support and to the lowest the means of dignity and

elevation; a property the tenure of which is the perfor-
mance of some duty (whatever value you may choose
to set on that duty), and the character of whose
proprietors demands at least an external decorum and
gravity of manners; who are to exercise a generous but
temperate hospitality; part of whose income they are
to consider as a trust for charity; and who, even when
they fail in their trust and slide from their character
and degenerate into a mere common secular noble-
man or gentleman, are in no respect worse than those
who may succeed them in their forfeited possessions?
Is it better that estates should be held by those who have no
duty than by those who have one?—by those whose character
and destination point to virtues than by those who have no
rule and direction in the expenditure of their estates but
their own will and appetite? Nor are these estates held
together in the manner of mortmain [a legal arrangement in
which a property owner such as an ecclesiastical institution is barred
from transferring or selling its property] or with the evils supposed
to be inherent in that. They pass from hand to hand with
a more rapid circulation than any other. No excess is good;
and, therefore, too great a proportion of landed property
may be held ofﬁcially for life; but it does not seem to me of
material injury to any commonwealth that there should exist
some estates that have a chance of being acquired by other
means than the previous acquisition of money.

Part 3

This letter has grown to a great length, though it is short
in relation to the inﬁnite extent of the subject. Various
occupations have from time to time called my mind from
the subject.
I was not sorry to give myself leisure to
observe whether I might ﬁnd in the National Assembly’s
proceedings reasons to change or to qualify some of my ﬁrst
sentiments. Everything has conﬁrmed me more strongly
in my ﬁrst opinions. It was my original purpose to survey
the principles of the National Assembly with regard to the
great and fundamental establishments, and to compare the
whole of what you have substituted in the place of what you
have destroyed with the corresponding items in our British
constitution [see page 51]. But this plan is of a greater extent
than I at ﬁrst calculated, and I ﬁnd that you have little desire
to learn from any examples. At present I must content myself
with some remarks on your establishments, reserving for
another time what I proposed to say about the spirit of our
British monarchy, aristocracy, and democracy. . . .

The incompetence of the National Assembly

I have taken a view of what has been done by the governing
power in France. I have certainly spoken of it with freedom.
Those whose principle it is to despise the ancient, permanent
sense of mankind and to set up a scheme of society on new
principles must naturally expect that such of us who think
better of the human race’s judgment than of theirs should
consider both them and their devices as men and schemes
upon their trial. They must take it for granted that we attend
much to their reason but not at all to their authority. They
have not one of the great inﬂuencing prejudices of mankind

in their favour. They avow their hostility to opinion. Of course
they must expect no support from that inﬂuence which they
have deposed from the seat of its jurisdiction, along with
every other authority.

I can never regard this Assembly as anything but a
voluntary association of men who have availed themselves of
circumstances to seize the power of the state. They do not
have the sanction and authority of the character under which
they ﬁrst met. They have assumed another very different
character and have completely altered and inverted all the
relations in which they originally stood. The authority they
exercise is not backed by any constitutional law of the state.
They have departed from the instructions of the people by
whom they were sent, though those instructions were the
sole source of their authority because the Assembly did not
act in virtue of any ancient usage or settled law. Their most
considerable acts have not been done by great majorities; and
in this sort of near divisions, which carry only the notional
authority of the whole, strangers will consider reasons as
well as resolutions.

If they had set up this new experimental government as a
necessary substitute for an expelled tyranny, mankind would
look ahead to the time of prescription [see Glossary] which
through long usage mellows into legality governments that
started in violence. All those whose feelings lead them to the
conservation of civil order would recognise as legitimate, even
in its cradle, the child produced by that force of necessity
to which all just governments owe their birth, and on which
they justify their continuance. But they will be slow and
reluctant in giving any sort of acceptance to the operations
of a power that derived its birth from no law and no necessity,

but which on the contrary had its origin in the vices and
sinister practices by which the social union is often disturbed
and sometimes destroyed. This Assembly has hardly a year’s
prescription. We have their own word for it that they have
made a revolution. To make a revolution is a measure which,
on the face of it, requires an apology [here = ‘a justiﬁcation’].
To make a revolution is to subvert the previous state of
our country, and extraordinary reasons are called for to
justify such a violent proceeding. The sense of mankind
authorises us to examine the mode of acquiring new power,
and to criticise the use that is made of it, with less awe
and reverence than is usually conceded to a settled and
recognised authority.

In •obtaining and •securing their power the Assembly
proceeds on principles the most opposite to those that appear
to direct them in the •use of it. An observation on this
difference will let us into the true spirit of their conduct.
Everything they have done or still do to obtain and keep their
power is by the most common arts. They proceed exactly as
their ancestors of ambition have done before them.—Trace
them through all their artiﬁces, frauds, and violences and
you’ll ﬁnd nothing that is new. They follow precedents and
examples with the punctilious exactness of an advocate in
a law-court. They never depart an iota from the authentic
formulas of tyranny and usurpation. But their spirit in all
the regulations concerning the public good has been the
very reverse of this. There they commit the whole ·populace·
to the mercy of untested speculations; they abandon the
public’s dearest interests to loose theories that none of them
would trust the slightest of his private concerns to. Why this
difference? Well, in obtaining and securing power they travel
in the beaten road because they are thoroughly in earnest
about that. They abandon the public interests wholly to
chance because they do not really care about them. I say

‘to chance’ because there is no empirical evidence that their
schemes are likely to be beneﬁcial.

We must always see with a pity not unmixed with respect
the errors of those who are timid and doubtful of themselves
in matters concerning the happiness of mankind. But in
these gentlemen there is nothing of the tender, parental
solicitude that fears to cut up the infant for the sake of
an experiment. In the vastness of their promises and the
conﬁdence of their predictions, they far outdo all the boasting
of hucksters selling fake medicine. The arrogance of their
claims provokes and challenges us to inquire into their
foundation.

Learning from difﬁculties

I am convinced that there are men of considerable ability
among the popular leaders in the National Assembly. Some of
them display eloquence in their speeches and their writings,
which is not possible without powerful and cultivated talents.
But eloquence can exist without a corresponding degree
of wisdom. When I speak of ability, I have to distinguish.
What they have done toward the support of their system
indicates that they are no ordinary men. In the system itself,
taken as the plan for a republic constructed for procuring
the prosperity and security of the citizen and for promot-
ing the strength and grandeur of the state, I cannot ﬁnd
anything that displays in a single instance the work of a
comprehensive and organising mind or even the provisions
of mere everyday prudence. Their purpose everywhere seems
to have been to evade and slip aside from difﬁculty. It has
been the glory of the great masters in all the arts [here includes
the sciences] to confront difﬁculties and overcome them; and
when they had overcome the ﬁrst difﬁculty, to turn it into
an instrument for new conquests over new difﬁculties, thus

91

Reﬂections on the Revolution in France

Edmund Burke

Part 3

enabling them to extend the scope of their science and even
to push forward, beyond the reach of their original thoughts,
the landmarks of the human understanding itself. Difﬁculty
is a severe instructor, set over us by the supreme ordinance
of a parental Guardian and Legislator who knows us better
than we know ourselves, as he loves us better too.
‘The
Father himself did not want the ploughman’s way to be easy’
[quoted in Latin from Virgil]. He that wrestles with us strengthens
our nerves and sharpens our skill. Our antagonist is our
helper. This amicable conﬂict with difﬁculty obliges us to
an intimate acquaintance with our object and compels us
to consider it in all its relations. It will not allow us to be
superﬁcial. It is the lack of nerves of understanding for such
a task—the degenerate fondness for tricking shortcuts and
little fallacious facilities—that has created governments with
arbitrary powers in so many parts of the world.

They have created the recent arbitrary monarchy of
France. They have created the arbitrary republic of Paris.
With them defects in wisdom are to be made up for by an
abundance of force. They get nothing by it. Commencing
their labours on a principle of sloth, they have the common
fortune of slothful men. The difﬁculties that they had dodged
rather than escaped meet them again down the road; they
multiply and thicken on them; they are involved, through
a labyrinth of confused detail, in an industry without limit
and without direction; and eventually the whole of their work
becomes feeble, vicious, and insecure.

This inability to wrestle with difﬁculty is what has obliged
the arbitrary Assembly of France to commence their schemes
of reform with abolition and total destruction. But is it in
destroying and pulling down that skill is displayed? Your
mob can do this as well at least as your assemblies. The
shallowest understanding, the roughest hand, is more than
equal to that task. Rage and frenzy will pull down more in

half an hour than prudence, deliberation, and foresight can
build up in a hundred years.

The errors and defects of old establishments are visible
and palpable. It calls for little ability to point them out; and
where absolute power is given, it requires only a word to
abolish the vice and the establishment together. The same
lazy but restless disposition which loves sloth and hates quiet
directs the politicians when they come to work on ﬁlling the
place of what they have destroyed. To make everything the
reverse of what they have seen is—·so they think·—quite as
easy as to destroy. No difﬁculties occur in what has never
been tried. Criticism is almost bafﬂed in discovering the
defects of what has not existed; and eager enthusiasm and
cheating hope have all the wide ﬁeld of imagination in which
they can hold forth with little or no opposition.

Reform

Reforming something while keeping it in existence is quite
another thing. When the useful parts of an old establishment
are kept, and what is added is to be ﬁtted to what is retained,
this requires the use of
•a vigorous mind,
•steady, persevering attention,
•various powers of comparison and combination, and
•the resources of an understanding fruitful
in
expedients;

these are to be exercised in a continued conﬂict with the
combined force of ·two· opposite vices, •the obstinacy that
rejects all improvement and •the levity [see Glossary] that is
fatigued and disgusted with everything it has. You may
object:

‘A process of this kind is slow.
It is not ﬁt for an
assembly that glories in performing in a few months

92

Reﬂections on the Revolution in France

Edmund Burke

Part 3

the work of ages. Such a mode of reforming ·as you
recommend· might take up many years.’

Without question it might; and it ought. When a method has
time as one of its assistants, one of its excellences is that its
operation is slow and in some cases almost imperceptible. If
circumspection and caution are a part of wisdom when we
work on inanimate matter, surely they become a part of duty
also when the subject of our demolition and construction
is not brick and timber but multitudes of sentient beings
who may be rendered miserable by the sudden alteration
of their state, condition, and habits. But it seems as if the
prevalent opinion in Paris is that the sole qualiﬁcations for a
perfect legislator are an unfeeling heart and an undoubting
conﬁdence. My ideas of that high ofﬁce are far different.
The true lawgiver ought to have a heart full of sensibility.
He ought to love and respect his kind, and to fear himself.
It may be allowed to his temperament to catch his ﬁnal
goal with an intuitive glance, but his movements toward it
ought to be deliberate. Political arrangement, being a work
for social ends, is to be done only by social means. In it,
mind must conspire with mind. Time is required to produce
the union of minds required to produce all the good we
aim at. Our patience will achieve more than our force. If I
might venture to appeal to something that is so much out
of fashion in Paris, I mean to experience, I should tell you
that in the course of my life I have known and (to the best of
my ability) co-operated with great men; and I have never yet
seen any plan that has not been mended by the observation
of people who were much inferior in understanding to the
person who took the lead in the business. By a slow but
well-sustained progress the effect of each step is watched;
the good or ill success of the ﬁrst step throws light on the
second; and so, from light to light, we are safely conducted
through the whole series. We see that the parts of the

system do not clash. The evils latent in the most promising
contrivances are provided for as they arise. One advantage
is as little as possible sacriﬁced to another. We compensate,
we reconcile, we balance. We are enabled to unite into
a consistent whole the various anomalies and contending
principles that are found in the minds and affairs of men.
What arises from this is not excellence in simplicity but
something far superior, excellence in composition. Where
the great interests of mankind are concerned through a long
series of generations, that series ought to be admitted into
some share in the councils that are going to affect them so
deeply. It’s not merely that justice requires this; the work
itself requires the aid of more minds than one age can provide.
It is from this view of things that the best legislators have
been often satisﬁed with the establishment of some sure,
solid, and ruling principle [see Glossary] in government—a
power like the one that some philosophers have called a
‘plastic nature’—and having ﬁxed the principle they have
then left it to its own operation.

To proceed in this way, i.e. with a presiding principle and
a proliﬁc energy, is for me the criterion of profound wisdom.
What your politicians take to be the marks of a bold, hardy
genius are only proofs of a deplorable lack of ability. By their
violent haste and their deﬁance of the process of nature, they
are delivered over blindly to every projector and adventurer,
to every alchemist and quack. They despair of turning to
account anything that is common, such as the place of diet
in preserving health. The worst of it is that their despair
of curing common illnesses by regular methods arises not
only from •defect of comprehension but also (I fear) from
•malignity of disposition. Your legislators seem to have taken
their opinions of all professions, ranks, and ofﬁces from
the declamations and buffooneries of satirists; who would
themselves be astonished if they were held to the letter of

93

Reﬂections on the Revolution in France

Edmund Burke

Part 3

their own descriptions. By listening only to these, your
leaders regard all things only on the side of their vices and
faults, and view those vices and faults under every colour of
exaggeration. It may seem paradoxical but is undoubtedly
true that

in general those who are habitually employed in ﬁnd-
ing and displaying faults are unqualiﬁed for the work
of reform, because not only are their minds not fur-
nished with patterns of the fair and good, but by habit
they come to take no delight in the contemplation of
such things.

By hating vices too much they come to love men too little. So
it is no wonder that they should be indisposed to serve them
and unable to do so. From this arises the disposition of some
of your guides to pull everything in pieces. At this malicious
game they display the whole of their four-handed activity.
As for the others, the paradoxes that eloquent writers have
brought forth purely as a sport of fancy to try their talents, to
attract attention and excite surprise, are taken up by these
gentlemen not

•in the spirit of the original authors, as means of
cultivating their taste and improving their style, but
•as serious grounds of action on the basis of which they
proceed in regulating the most important concerns of
the state.

Cicero has fun describing Cato as trying to act in the com-
monwealth on the basis of school paradoxes that exercised
the wits of the junior students in the Stoic philosophy. If this
was true of Cato, these gentlemen copy him in the manner of
some of his contemporaries. [Burke here throws in a three-word
Latin phrase, which points to a passage in which Horace mocked people
who thought they could match Cato by going barefoot and wearing a
tattered toga.] Mr Hume told me that he had from Rousseau
himself the secret of his principles of composition. That acute

though eccentric observer had perceived that to strike and
interest the public something marvellous must be produced;
that the marvellous of the heathen mythology had long since
lost its effect; that the giants, magicians, fairies, and heroes
of romance which followed had exhausted the portion of
credulity that belonged to their age; that now nothing was
left to the writer but that kind of marvel that might still
be produced, and with as great an effect as ever, though
in another way—namely the marvellous in life, in manners,
in characters, and in extraordinary situations, giving rise
to new and unlooked-for strokes in politics and morals. I
believe that if Rousseau were alive and in one of his lucid
intervals, he would be shocked at the practical frenzy of his
scholars, who in their paradoxes are servile imitators, and
even in their incredulity reveal an implicit faith.

Men who undertake considerable things, even in a regular
way, ought to give us reason to think they are able. But
the physician of the state who undertakes not only to cure
illnesses but to regenerate constitutions ought to show
uncommon powers. Some very unusual appearances of
wisdom ought to display themselves on the face of the designs
of those who make no appeal to past practice and do not
copy any model. Has any such been manifested? I shall
survey what the Assembly has done with regard (i) to the
constitution of the legislature, (ii) to that of the executive
power, (iii) to that of the judicature, (iv) to the model of
the army, and ﬁnally (v) to the system of ﬁnance; to see
whether we can discover in any part of their schemes the
awesome ability that might justify these bold undertakers in
the superiority they assume over mankind. Relative to the
size of the subject the survey will be a very short one.

(i) The constitution of the legislature

It is in the model of the
[Burke’s topic (i) will run to page 108.]
sovereign and presiding part of this new republic that we
should expect their grand display. Here they were to prove
their title to their proud demands. For the plan itself at
large, and for the reasons on which it is grounded, I refer
to the journals of the Assembly of 29.ix.1789 and such
subsequent proceedings as made any alterations in the plan.
So far as I can see light in a somewhat confused matter,
the system remains substantially as it was originally formed.
My few remarks will be addressed to its spirit, its tendency
[= ‘its probable effects’], and its ﬁtness for forming a popular
commonwealth (which they profess theirs to be) suited to the
purposes for which any commonwealth, and particularly a
popular one, is made. At the same time I mean to consider
its consistency with itself and its own principles.

Old establishments are tested by their effects.

If the
people are happy, united, wealthy, and powerful, we presume
the rest. We conclude something to be good if good comes
from it. In old establishments various correctives have been
found for their aberrations from theory. Indeed, they are
the results of various necessities and expediencies. They
are not often constructed on the basis of any theory; rather,
theories are drawn from them. In them we often see that
the best way to the goal is through means that seem not to
be perfectly consistent with what we originally planned to
be doing. The means taught by experience may be better
suited to political ends than those contrived in the original
project. They react back on the original constitution, and
sometimes bring improvements to the design itself that
they seem to have departed from.
I think all this might
be exempliﬁed in the British constitution. At worst, the
errors and deviations of every kind in reckoning are found

and computed, and the ship proceeds in her course. This
is the case of old establishments; but in a new and merely
theoretic system every contrivance is expected to appear, on
the face of it, to be right for its purpose, especially when
those who are launching it are in no way constrained by
attempts to accommodate the new building to an old one,
either in the walls or on the foundations.

The French builders, clearing away as mere rubbish
whatever they found and (like their ornamental gardeners)
putting everything onto an exact level, propose to rest the
whole local and general legislature on bases of three different
kinds:

•one geometrical, which they call the basis of territory,
•one arithmetical, the basis of population and
•one ﬁnancial, the basis of contribution.

(1) For purposes of bringing in territory, they divide their
country into (a) 83 pieces, each a square of 18 square leagues.
These large divisions are called Departments. They subdivide
these into (b) 1720 square districts called Communes, which
they further subdivide into (c) 6400 square districts called
Cantons.

At ﬁrst view this geometrical basis of theirs presents
nothing much to admire or to blame. It calls for no great
legislative talents. For such a plan as this all that is needed is
an accurate land surveyor, with his chain, sight, and theodo-
lite. In the old divisions of the country, various accidents
at various times and the ebb and ﬂow of various properties
and jurisdictions settled their boundaries. These boundaries
were not made on any ﬁxed system, undoubtedly. They
involved inconveniences, but use had found remedies for
these and habit had supplied accommodation and patience.
In this new pavement of square within square, and this
organisation and semi-organisation made on the system of
Empedocles and Buffon and not on any political principle,

95

Reﬂections on the Revolution in France

Edmund Burke

Part 3

there are bound to be countless local inconveniences to
which men are not habituated. But these I pass over,
because to specify them requires an accurate knowledge
of the country, which I do not have.

When these state surveyors came to take a view of their
work of measurement, they soon found that in politics the
most fallacious of all things was geometrical demonstration.
They then had recourse to another basis (or rather buttress)
to support the building that was tottering on that false
foundation. It was evident that the goodness of the soil, the
number of the people, their wealth, and the largeness of their
contribution made such inﬁnite variations between square
and square as •to make sheer size a ridiculous standard
of power in the commonwealth, and •to make geometrical
equality the most unequal of all measures in the distribution
of men. However, they could not give it up. Instead, they
divided their political and civil representation into three parts
and allotted one of those parts to the square measurement,
without a single fact or calculation to ascertain whether this
territorial proportion of representation was fairly assigned,
whether on any principle it really ought to be one-third.
Anyway, having given to geometry one-third as her dower—as
a compliment, I suppose, to that sublime science—they left
the other two-thirds to be scufﬂed for between the other
parts, population and contribution.

(2) When they came to provide for population, they could
not proceed quite as smoothly as they had done in the ﬁeld
of their geometry. Here their arithmetic came to bear on their
juridical metaphysics. If they had stuck to their metaphysical
principles, the arithmetical process would have been simple:
they hold that all men are strictly equal and entitled to equal
rights in their own government. Each head, on this system,
would have its vote, and every man would vote directly for
the person who was to represent him in the legislature.

‘But soft—by regular degrees, not yet.’ This metaphysical
principle to which law, custom, usage, policy and reason
were to yield is itself to yield to their pleasure. There must
be many degrees, and some stages, before the representative
can come into contact with his constituent. Indeed, as we
shall soon see, these two persons are to have no sort of
communication with each other. (c) First, the voters in the
Canton, who compose what they call ‘primary assemblies’,
are to have a qualiﬁcation. What! a qualiﬁcation on the
indefeasible rights of men? Yes; but it will be a very small
qualiﬁcation. Our injustice will be very little oppressive:
only the local valuation of three days’ labour paid to the
public. [That is: to belong to a primary assembly a man must pay an
amount equal to three days’ pay in his locality.] This is not much, I
readily admit, for anything but the utter subversion of your
equalizing principle. As a qualiﬁcation it might as well be let
alone, for it achieves no one purpose for which qualiﬁcations
are established; and on your ideas it excludes from a vote the
man of all others whose natural equality stands the most in
need of protection and defence—I mean the man who ·cannot
afford the qualifying payment, and so· has nothing but his
natural equality to guard him. You order him to buy the
right of which you had earlier told him that nature had given
it to him, free, at his birth, and that no authority on earth
could lawfully deprive him of it. With regard to the person
who cannot come up to your market ·price·, a tyrannous
aristocracy is established against him at the very outset by
you who pretend to be its sworn foe.

The gradation proceeds. These primary assemblies of the
Canton elect (b) deputies to the Commune; one for every two
hundred qualiﬁed inhabitants. Here is the ﬁrst intermediary
between the primary elector and the representative legislator,
and here a new toll-gate is ﬁxed for taxing the rights of men
with a second qualiﬁcation: to be elected into the Commune

96

Reﬂections on the Revolution in France

Edmund Burke

Part 3

a person has to pay the amount of ten days’ labour. And
we are not done yet. There is still to be another gradation.
These Communes, chosen by the Canton, choose to (a) the
Department; and the deputies of the Department choose
their deputies to the National Assembly. Here is a third
barrier of a senseless qualiﬁcation. Every deputy to the
National Assembly must pay a direct contribution with the
value of a mark of silver. All these qualifying barriers are
powerless to secure independence, strong only in destroying
the rights of men.

In all this process, which in its fundamental elements
purports to consider only population on a principle of natural
right, there is a manifest attention to property; and this,
however just and reasonable on other schemes, is perfectly
indefensible on theirs.

(3) When they come to their third basis, contribution,
we ﬁnd that they have more completely lost sight of their
rights of men. This last basis rests entirely on property, thus
admitting a principle totally different from the equality of
men, and utterly irreconcilable to it. But no sooner is this
principle admitted than (as usual) it is subverted; and it is
not subverted (as we shall presently see) so as to get the
inequality of riches to approximate to the level of nature.
The additional share in the third portion of representation
(a portion reserved exclusively for the higher contribution)
is made with regard only to the district and not to the
individuals in it who pay. The course of their reasonings
make it easy to see how embarrassed by their contradictory
ideas of the rights of men and the privileges of riches. The
committee of constitution virtually admit that they are wholly
irreconcilable. They say:

‘The relation with regard to the contributions is
without doubt null when the question concerns the
balance of the political rights as between individual

and individual, without which personal equality would
be destroyed and an aristocracy of the rich would be
established. But this inconvenience entirely disap-
pears when the proportional relation of the contribu-
tion is only considered in the great masses, and is
solely between province and province; it serves in that
case only to form a just proportion between the cities
without affecting the personal rights of the citizens.’
Here the principle of contribution, as taken between man
and man, is rejected as null and destructive to equality, and
also as pernicious because it leads to the establishment of an
aristocracy of the rich. However, it must not be abandoned.
And the way of getting rid of the difﬁculty is to establish the
inequality as between department and department, leaving
all the individuals in each department on an exact par.
Notice that this equality between individuals had been before
destroyed when the qualiﬁcations within the departments
were settled; nor does it seem to matter much whether the
equality of men is injured by masses or individually. An
individual is not as important in a mass represented by a few
as in a mass represented by many. It would be too much to
tell a man who is touchy about his equality that the elector
who votes for three members has the same franchise as the
one who votes for ten.

Wealth and representation

Let us suppose that their principle of representation
according to contribution—i.e. according to riches—is well
thought-out and is a necessary basis for their republic. In
this third basis of theirs they assume that •riches ought to
be respected, and that justice and policy require that •they
should entitle men to have in some way a larger share in
the administration of public affairs; it is now to be seen

97

Reﬂections on the Revolution in France

Edmund Burke

Part 3

how the Assembly provides for the pre-eminence, or even for
the security, of the rich by using their afﬂuence as a basis
for conferring on their district the larger measure of power
that is denied to them personally. I readily admit (indeed
I should lay it down as a fundamental principle) that in a
republican government that has a democratic basis the rich
do require more security than they need in monarchies. They
are subject to envy, and through envy to oppression. On the
present scheme it is impossible to see what advantage they
get from the aristocratic preference on which the unequal
representation of the masses is founded. The rich cannot
feel it either as a support to their dignity or as security to
their fortune, because the aristocratic mass is generated
from purely democratic principles, and the preference given
to it in the general representation has no reference to or
connection with the persons on account of whose property
this superiority of the mass is established. . . . The contest
between the rich and the poor is not a struggle between
corporation and corporation, but a contest between men
and men—a competition not between districts but between
descriptions [see Glossary]. It would answer its purpose better
if the scheme were inverted: that the vote of the masses were
rendered equal, and that the votes within each mass were
proportioned to property.

Suppose one man in a district contributes as much as a
hundred of his neighbours. Against these he has only one
vote. If there were only one representative for the mass, his
poor neighbours would outvote him 100:1 for that single
representative. Bad enough. But amends are to be made
to him. How? The district, in virtue of his wealth, is to
choose (say) ten members instead of one; that is to say, by
paying a very large contribution he has the happiness of
being outvoted 100:1 by the poor for ten representatives,
instead of being outvoted 100:1 for a single member. In fact

the rich man, instead of beneﬁting by this superior quantity
of representation, is subjected to an additional hardship.
The increase of representation within his province sets up
nine persons more—and as many more than nine as there
may be democratic candidates—to plot and intrigue and to
ﬂatter the people at his expense and to his oppression. An
interest is by this means held out to multitudes of the inferior
sort, in obtaining a salary of eighteen livres a day (to them a
vast sum) besides the pleasure of a residence in Paris and
their share in the government of the kingdom. The more the
objects of ambition are multiplied and become democratic,
the more the rich are endangered.

Thus it must fare between the poor and the rich in the
province regarded as aristocratic, though internally it is the
very reverse of that. As for its relation to the other provinces,
I cannot see how the unequal representation that is given to
masses on account of wealth becomes a means for preserving
the balance and tranquillity of the commonwealth. If one
of the objectives is to secure the weak from being crushed
by the strong (as in all society it undoubtedly is), how are
the smaller and poorer of these masses to be saved from
the tyranny of the wealthier ones? Is it by adding to the
wealthy further and more systematic means of oppressing
them? When we come to a balance of representation between
corporate bodies, provincial interests and emulations and
jealousies are just as likely to arise among them as among
individuals; and their divisions are likely to produce stronger
dissension and something leading more nearly to a war.

[Burke now presents one extremely complex page present-
ing further defects in the system in which representation
depends in part on contribution; followed by more than two
pages of arithmetically detailed discussion of some ﬁctional
examples, showing that under the National Assembly’s sys-
tem one person may pay much more into the public purse

98

while having much less representation in the Assembly, for
reasons having to do with how many people live in the same
arbitrarily drawn square as he does, and with the average
poverty or afﬂuence of those people. An excuse for letting
ourselves off all this comes from how he continues:]

I am afraid I have gone too far into their way of considering
the formation of a constitution. They have much, but bad,
metaphysics; much, but bad, geometry; much, but false,
proportionate arithmetic; but if it were all as exact as meta-
physics, geometry, and arithmetic ought to be, and if their
schemes were perfectly consistent in all their parts, all that
would produce is something that looks more elegant. It is
remarkable that in this great arrangement of mankind not
one reference is made to anything moral or anything political,
nothing that relates to the concerns, actions, passions, and
interests of men. . . .

You see I consider this constitution only as electoral, as
leading by steps to the National Assembly. I do not enter
into the internal government of the (a) departments and their
genealogy through the (b) communes and (c) cantons. In the
original plan these local governments are to be as nearly as
possible composed in the same manner and on the same
principles as the elective assemblies. Each of them is a body
perfectly compact and rounded in itself.

Treating France like a conquered country

You cannot help seeing that this scheme has a direct and im-
mediate tendency to cut France up into a variety of republics,
making them totally independent of each other without any
direct constitutional means of coherence, connection, or
subordination, except what can come from their going along
with the decisions of the general congress of the ambassadors
from each independent republic. That is what the National

Assembly really is. I admit that such governments do exist
in the world, though in forms inﬁnitely more suitable to the
local and habitual circumstances of their people. But such
associations (not really political bodies) have generally been
the effect of necessity, not choice; and I believe the present
French power is the very ﬁrst body of citizens who, having
obtained full authority to do with their country what they
pleased, have chosen to cut it up in this barbarous manner.
It is impossible not to observe that in the spirit of this
geometrical distribution and arithmetical arrangement these
pretended citizens treat France exactly like a conquered
country. Acting as conquerors, they have imitated the
policy of the harshest of that harsh race. The policy of
such barbarous victors, who contemn a subdued people and
insult their feelings, has always been as much as possible
to destroy all vestiges of the ancient country, in religion, in
polity, in laws, and in manners; to confound all territorial
limits; to produce general poverty; to put up their properties
to auction; to crush their princes, nobles, and pontiffs; to
lay low everything that had lifted its head above the level
or that could serve to combine or rally their distressed and
disbanded people under the standard of old opinion. They
have made France ‘free’ in the way the Romans, those sincere
friends of the rights of mankind, ‘freed’ Greece, Macedon,
and other nations. They destroyed the bonds of their union
on the pretence of providing for the independence of each of
their cities.

When the members who compose these new bodies of
cantons, communes, and departments—arrangements pur-
posely produced through the medium of confusion—begin to
act, they will ﬁnd themselves in a great measure strangers to
one another. The electors and elected throughout, especially
in the rural cantons, will be frequently without any civil
habitudes or connections, or any of the natural discipline

that is the soul of a true republic. Magistrates and collectors
of revenue are now no longer acquainted with their districts,
bishops with their dioceses, or curates with their parishes.
These new colonies of the rights of men bear a strong
resemblance to the sort of military colonies that Tacitus
commented on in the declining policy of Rome.
In better
and wiser days (whatever course they took with foreign na-
tions) they were careful to make the elements of methodical
subordination and settlement to be coeval, and even to lay
the foundations of civil discipline in the military. But when
all the good arts had fallen into ruin, they proceeded as
your Assembly does on the equality of men, and with as little
judgment or care for the things that make a republic tolerable
or durable. But in this as in almost everything, your new
commonwealth is born and bred and fed in the corruptions
that mark degenerated and worn-out republics. Your child
comes into the world with the symptoms of death: the facies
Hippocratica forms the character of its facial appearance
and the prognostic of its fate. [The facies Hippocratica is the face
of someone who is starving, super-exhausted, dying, or the like.]

The legislators who formed the ancient republics knew
that their business was too arduous to be accomplished with
no better apparatus than the metaphysics of an undergradu-
ate, and the mathematics and arithmetic of a tax-collector.
They had to do with men, and were obliged to study human
nature. They had to do with citizens, and were obliged
to study the effects of the habits that are communicated
by the circumstances of civil life. They were aware that
the operation of this second nature on the ﬁrst produced
a new combination; and from that arose many diversities
among men, according to their birth, their education, their
professions, the periods of their lives, their residence in
towns or in the country, their various ways of acquiring
and of ﬁxing property, and according to the quality of the

property itself—all of which made them so many different
species of animals, as it were. From hence they thought
themselves obliged to •sort their citizens into classes, and
to place them in situations in the state, appropriate to their
particular habits, and to •give them privileges

•that are needed to secure for them what their particu-
lar occasions require, and
•that might provide each description with force to
protect itself in the conﬂicts caused by the diversity
of interests that must exist and must quarrel in any
complex society.

The legislator would have been ashamed if

the coarse husbandman knew how to sort and to use
his sheep, horses, and oxen, and had enough common
sense not to abstract and equalise them all into mere
animals in general without providing for each kind an
appropriate food, care, and employment,

while

he, the economist, disposer and shepherd of his own
kindred, elevating himself into an airy metaphysician,
was resolved to know nothing of his ﬂocks except as
men in general.

That is why Montesquieu remarked very justly that the
great legislators of antiquity made the greatest display of
their powers, and even soared above themselves, in their
classiﬁcation of the citizens.
It is here that your modern
legislators have gone deep into the negative series, and sunk
even below their own nothing. As the ﬁrst sort of legislators
attended to the different kinds of citizens and combined
them into one commonwealth, the others—the metaphysical
and alchemistic legislators—have taken the directly opposite
course. They have done their best to run all sorts of citizens
together into one homogeneous mass; and then they divided
this mass of theirs into a number of incoherent republics.

They reduce men to loose counters, merely for the sake of
simple counting, and not to ﬁgures whose power is to arise
from their place in the table. . . .

They have levelled and crushed together all the orders
that they found, even under the coarse unartiﬁcial arrange-
ment of the monarchy where the classifying of the citizens
is less important than it is in a republic. But every such
classiﬁcation, if properly ordered, is good in all forms of
government: it creates a strong barrier against the excesses
of despotism, and is the necessary means of giving effect
and permanence to a republic. For lack of something of
this kind, if the present project of a republic should fail, all
securities to a moderated freedom fail along with it; all the
indirect restraints that mitigate despotism are removed, so
that if monarchy ever again obtains an entire ascendancy
in France, under this or under any other dynasty, if it is
not voluntarily tempered from the outset by the wise and
virtuous counsels of the prince, it will probably be the most
completely arbitrary power ever seen on earth. This is to play
a most desperate game.

They even declare that one of their objectives is the
confusion that comes with all such proceedings: they hope
to secure their constitution by a terror of a return of those
evils that came with their making it. ‘By this,’ they say, ‘its
destruction will become difﬁcult for any authority, which
cannot break it up without the entire disorganisation of
the whole state.’ They presume that if this ·take-over·
authority ever came to the same degree of power that they
have acquired, it would make a more moderate and chastised
use of it, and would piously tremble to entirely disorganise
the state in the savage manner that they have done. They
look to the virtues of returning despotism for the security
that is to be enjoyed by the offspring of their popular vices.

Consequences of the fragmenting of France

I wish, Sir, that you and my readers would attend carefully to
the work of M. de Calonne on this subject. It is an eloquent,
able and instructive performance. I conﬁne myself to what
he says relating to the constitution of the new state and to
the condition of the revenue. I do not wish to pronounce on
this minister’s disputes with his rivals. Nor do I mean to risk
any opinion concerning his ways and means—ﬁnancial or
political—for taking his country out of its present deplorable
situation of servitude, anarchy, bankruptcy, and beggary.
I am less optimistic than he is; but he is a Frenchman, and
has a closer duty relative to those topics than I can have,
and better means of judging concerning them. I would like
special attention to be paid to the explicit announcement
that he refers to, made by one of the principal leaders in
the Assembly, concerning the tendency of their scheme to
bring France not only from a monarchy to a republic but
from a republic to a mere confederacy. It adds new force to
my observations, and indeed M. de Calonne’s work makes
up for my deﬁciencies by many new and striking arguments
on most of the subjects of this letter.

This resolution to break their country into separate
republics is what has driven them into the greatest number
of their difﬁculties and contradictions. If it were not for this,
all the questions of exact equality and these never-to-be-
settled balances of

individual rights — population — contribution

would be wholly useless. The representation, though derived
from parts, would be a duty that equally concerned the whole.
Each deputy to the Assembly would be the representative
of France, and of all its descriptions [see Glossary], of the
many and the few, of the rich and the poor, of the great
districts and the small. All these districts would themselves

101

Reﬂections on the Revolution in France

Edmund Burke

Part 3

be subordinate to some standing authority that existed inde-
pendently of them, an authority in which their representation
(and everything pertaining to it) originated and to which it
was pointed. This government—standing, unalterable, and
fundamental—is the only thing that could make that territory
truly and properly a whole. In Great Britain when we elect
popular representatives we send them to a council—·the
House of Commons·—in which each man individually is a
subject and submitted to a government that is complete in
all its ordinary functions. With you the elective Assembly
is the sovereign, the sole sovereign, so all its members are
integral parts of this sole sovereignty. But with us it is
totally different. With us the representative, separated from
the other parts, can have no action and no existence. The
government is the point of reference of the various members
and districts of our representation. This is the centre of
our unity. This government of reference is a trustee for •the
whole and not for •the parts. So is the other branch of our
public council, I mean the House of Lords. With us the king
and the lords are several and joint securities for the equality
of each district, each province, each city. When did you hear
of any province in Great Britain suffering from the inequality
of its representation or from having no representation at all?
Not only our monarchy and our peerage secure the equality
on which our unity depends, but it is the spirit of the House
of Commons itself. The very inequality of representation that
is so foolishly complained of is perhaps the very thing which
prevents us from thinking or acting as members for districts.
Cornwall elects as many members as all Scotland. But is
Cornwall better taken care of than Scotland? Apart from the
members of some giddy clubs, few here trouble their heads
about any of your bases. . . .

Your new constitution is the very reverse of ours in its
principle; and I am astonished that anyone could dream

of offering anything done in it as an example for Great
Britain. With you there is little connection—actually, no
connection—between the last representative and the ﬁrst
constituent. The member who goes to the National Assembly
is not chosen by the people or accountable to them. There are
three elections before he is chosen; two sets of magistracy
intervene between him and the primary assembly, so as
to make him (I repeat) •an ambassador of a state and not
•a representative of the people within a state. The whole
spirit of the election is changed by this, and no corrective de-
vised by your constitution-mongers can make him anything
but what he is. The very attempt to do it would inevitably
introduce a more horrid confusion than the present, if such
a thing is possible. The only way to connect the original
constituent with the representative is by circuitous means
which lead the candidate to apply in the ﬁrst instance to
the primary electors, in order that by their authoritative
instructions (and something more perhaps) these primary
electors may force the two succeeding bodies of electors to
make a choice agreeable to their wishes. But this would
plainly subvert the whole scheme. It would •plunge them
back into the tumult and confusion of popular election which
they mean to avoid by their interposed gradation of elections,
and at length •put the whole fortune of the state in the
hands of those who have the least knowledge of it and the
least interest in it. This is a perpetual dilemma into which
they are thrown by the vicious, weak, and contradictory
principles they have chosen. Unless the people break up and
ﬂatten this gradation they obviously do not really elect to the
Assembly—indeed, they don’t even appear to do so.

What are we all looking for in an election? To meet its
real purposes, you must ﬁrst be able to know the ﬁtness of
your man, and then you must retain some hold on him by
personal obligation or dependence. What can the primary

102

Reﬂections on the Revolution in France

Edmund Burke

Part 3

electors ·in your system· be looking for? They can never
know anything of the qualities of the person who is to serve
them, nor has he any obligation whatsoever to them. Of all
the powers unﬁt to be delegated by those who have any real
means of judging, the most unﬁt is anything that relates to
a personal choice. In case of abuse, your body of primary
electors never can call the representative to an account for
his conduct: he is too distant from them in the chain of
representation. If he acts improperly at the end of his two
years’ term, it does not concern him for two years more.
By the new French constitution the best and the wisest
representatives go equally with the worst into this set-aside
status. Their hulls are supposed to have barnacles, so they
must go into dock to be reﬁtted. Every man who has served
in an assembly is ineligible for two years after. Just as
these magistrates begin to learn their trade, like chimney
sweepers, they are disqualiﬁed for exercising it. . . . Your
constitution has too much jealousy to have much sense in
it. You consider the breach of trust in the representative so
principally that you do not at all regard the question of his
ﬁtness to execute it.

This set-aside interval is not unfavourable to a faithless
representative, who may be as good a canvasser as he was
a bad governor.
In this time he may plot his way into
a superiority over the wisest and most virtuous. All the
members of this elective constitution are equally ﬂeeting
and exist only for the election, so the persons who originally
chose him may be quite different from the ones to whom
he is to be responsible when he asks for a renewal of his
trust. To call all the secondary electors of the Commune to
account is ridiculous, impracticable, and unjust; they may
themselves have been deceived in their choice, as the third
set of electors, those of the Department, may be in theirs. In
your elections responsibility cannot exist.

Cement 1: paper money

Finding no sort of principle [see Glossary] of coherence with
each other in the nature and constitution of the many new
republics of France, I considered what cement the legislators
had provided for them from any extraneous materials. I take
no notice of their confederations, their spectacles, their civic
feasts, and their fanatical excitement; those are mere tricks.
But tracing their policy through their actions, I think I can
pick out the arrangements by which they propose to hold
these republics together. The ﬁrst is the conﬁscation, with
the accompanying paper currency; the second is the supreme
power of the city of Paris; the third is the general army of the
state, which I shan’t discuss until ·page 114, when· I come
to consider the army as a separate topic.

I cannot deny that the operation of the conﬁscation
and the paper currency—one depending on the other—may
for some time constitute some sort of cement, unless the
madness and folly in their management and in the adjusting
of the parts to make them ﬁt produces a repulsion at the very
outset. But admitting the scheme to have some coherence
and some duration, I think that if after a while the conﬁs-
cation turns out not to be sufﬁcient to support the paper
currency (as I am morally certain it will not), then instead of
cementing these confederate republics together it will add
inﬁnitely to their dissociation, distraction, and confusion. . . .
And if the conﬁscation sinks the paper currency, the cement
is gone with the circulation. In the meantime its binding
force will be uncertain, tightening or loosening with every
variation in the credit of the paper.

The only thing that is certain in this scheme is its effect
in producing an oligarchy in every one of the republics. (This
looks like a side-effect, but I have no doubt that in the minds
of those who conduct this business it is directly aimed at.)

Part 3

A paper circulation

•not backed by any real money deposited or promised,
•amounting now to £44,000,000 of English money, and
•compulsorily substituted for the coin of the kingdom,
thus becoming the substance of its revenue as well as
the medium of all its commercial and civil business,
must put into the hands of the managers and conductors of
this circulation the whole of whatever power, authority, and
inﬂuence is left.

In England we feel the inﬂuence of the Bank, though it
is only the centre of a voluntary dealing. You would have to
know little indeed of the inﬂuence of money on mankind if
you did not see the force of the management of a moneyed
concern that is •so much more extensive and •so much
more dependent on the managers than any of ours are. But
this is not merely a money concern. Another working part
of the system is inseparably connected with this money
management, namely the means of drawing out at discretion
portions of the conﬁscated lands for sale, and carrying on
a process of continual change of paper into land, and of
land into paper. When we follow this process in its effects
we can conceive something of the intensity of the force with
which this system must operate. By this means the spirit of
money-jobbing and speculation goes into the mass of land
itself and incorporates with it. By this kind of operation
that sort of property becomes (as it were) volatilised; it
assumes an unnatural and monstrous activity, and thereby
throws into the hands of the various managers—principal
and subordinate, Parisian and provincial—all the ‘money’
and perhaps a full 10% of all the land in France, which
has now acquired the worst and most pernicious part of the
evil of a paper circulation, namely great uncertainty in its
value. . . .

The new dealers, being all habitually adventurers and

without any ﬁxed habits or local biases, will purchase so as to
re-sell, as the market of paper or of money or of land presents
an advantage. A holy bishop—·Talleyrand, bishop of Autun·—
thinks that agriculture will derive great advantages from
the ‘enlightened’ usurers who are to purchase the church
conﬁscations. Well, I am an old farmer if not a good one;
and with great humility I beg leave to tell his late lordship
that usury is not a tutor to agriculture; and if the word
‘enlightened’ is understood according to the new dictionary,
as it always is in your new schools, I cannot conceive how
a man’s not believing in God can teach him to cultivate the
earth with the slightest additional skill or encouragement.
‘I sow to the immortal gods’, said an old Roman, when he
held one handle of the plough while Death held the other. You
could bring together •all the directors of the two academies
and •the directors of the Caisse d’Escompte, and one old
experienced peasant is worth them all. I have learned more
about a curious and interesting branch of husbandry in
one short conversation with an old Carthusian monk than
I have derived from all the Bank directors I ever talked
with. But there is no cause for anxiety about money dealers
meddling with the rural economy. These gentlemen are too
wise in their generation. At ﬁrst, perhaps, their tender and
susceptible imaginations may be captivated by the innocent
and unproﬁtable delights of a pastoral life; but they will soon
ﬁnd that agriculture is a more laborious and less lucrative
trade than the one they had left. After making its panegyric,
they will turn their backs on it. . . . They will cultivate the
Caisse d’Eglise, under the sacred auspices of this prelate,
with much more proﬁt than its vineyards and its cornﬁelds.
They will employ their talents according to their habits and
their interests. They will not follow the plough while they
can direct treasuries and govern provinces.

A nation of gamblers

Your legislators, in everything new, are the ﬁrst to found a
commonwealth on gaming [= ‘gambling’], infusing this spirit
into it as its vital breath. The great aim in these politics is to
change France from a great kingdom into a great play-table;
to turn its inhabitants into a nation of gamesters; to make
speculation as extensive as life; to mix it with all its concerns
and to divert the whole of the hopes and fears of the people
from their usual channels into the impulses, passions, and
superstitions of those who live on chances. They loudly
proclaim that their present system of a republic cannot
possibly exist without this kind of gaming fund, and that the
very thread of its life is spun out of the raw materials of these
speculations. The old gaming in funds was harmful enough,
undoubtedly, but only to individuals. Even when it had its
greatest extent, in the Mississippi and South Sea, it affected
comparatively few. . . . But where the law, which in most
circumstances forbids gaming and in none countenances it,
is itself debauched so as to reverse its nature and policy and
openly force the subject to this destructive table by bringing
the spirit and symbols of gaming into the minutest matters
and engaging everybody in it, a more dreadful epidemic
illness of that kind is spread than yet has appeared in the
world. With you a man can neither earn nor buy his dinner
without a speculation. What he receives in the morning will
not have the same value at night. What he is compelled to
take as payment for an old debt will not be received as the
same when he comes to pay a debt contracted by himself,
nor will it be the same when by prompt payment he would
avoid contracting any debt at all.
Industry must wither
away. Economy must be driven from your country. Careful
provision will have no existence. Who will labour without
knowing the amount of his pay? Who will study to increase

what none can estimate? Who will accumulate, when he
does not know the value of what he saves? If you abstract it
from its uses in gaming, to accumulate your paper wealth
would be not the providence of a man but the crazy instinct
of a jackdaw.

The truly melancholy part of the policy of systematically
making a nation of gamesters is this: all are forced to play
but few can understand the game, and fewer still are in a
position to make use of the knowledge. The many must
be the dupes of the few who conduct the machine of these
speculations. What effect it must have on the country people
is visible. The townsman can calculate from day to day,
not so the inhabitant of the country. When the peasant
ﬁrst brings his corn to market, the magistrate in the towns
obliges him to take the assignat [see Glossary] at par; when he
goes to the shop with his money he ﬁnds it 7% the worse
for crossing the street. He will not readily go to this market
again. The townspeople will be inﬂamed; they will force the
country people to bring their corn. Resistance will begin, and
the murders of Paris and St. Denis may be renewed through
all France.

In your theory of representation the country is perhaps
given more than its share. What does this empty compliment
signify? Where have you placed the real power over moneyed
and landed circulation? Where have you placed the means
of raising and lowering the value of every man’s freehold?
Those whose operations can take from or add 10% to the
possessions of every man in France must be the masters of
every man in France. The whole of the power obtained by this
revolution will settle in the towns among the burghers and
the moneyed directors who lead them. The landed gentleman,
the yeoman, and the peasant do not, any of them, have
habits or inclinations or experience that can lead them to
any share in this, which is the sole source of power and

105

Reﬂections on the Revolution in France

Edmund Burke

Part 3

inﬂuence now left in France. The very nature of a country
life, the very nature of landed property, in all the occupa-
tions and pleasures they provide, render combination and
arrangement (the sole way of getting and exerting inﬂuence)
impossible among country people. Combine them by all the
art you can, and all the industry, they are always dissolving
into individuality. Anything in the nature of incorporation
is almost impracticable among them. Hope, fear, alarm,
jealousy, the ephemeral rumour that does its business and
dies in a day—these are the reins and spurs by which leaders
check or urge the minds of followers, and they are not easily
employed among scattered people. They assemble, they
arm, they act with the utmost difﬁculty and at the greatest
charge. Their efforts, if ever they can be started, cannot
be sustained. They cannot proceed systematically. If the
country gentlemen attempt an inﬂuence through the mere
income of their property, what can they do against those who
have ten times their income to sell and who can ruin their
property by bringing their plunder to meet it at the market?
If the landed man takes out a mortgage, he lowers the value
of his land and raises the value of assignats [see Glossary]. He
increases his enemy’s power by the very means he must take
to contend with him. So the country gentleman, the man of
liberal views and habits, attached to no profession, will be
as completely excluded from the government of his country
as if he were an outlaw.
It is obvious that in the towns
all the things that conspire against the country gentleman
combine in favour of the money manager and director. In
towns combination is natural. The habits of burghers, their
occupations, their diversion, their business, their idleness
continually bring them into mutual contact. Their virtues
and their vices are sociable; they are always in garrison; and
they come embodied and half disciplined into the hands of
those who plan to use them for civil or military action.

All these considerations leave no doubt in my mind that
if this monster of a constitution can continue France will
be wholly governed by the agitators in corporations, by
societies in the towns formed of directors of assignats, and
trustees for the sale of church lands, attorneys, agents,
money jobbers, speculators, and adventurers, composing
an ignoble oligarchy based on the destruction of the crown,
the church, the nobility, and the people. Here end all the
deceitful dreams and visions of the equality and rights of
men. In the Serbonian bog [look it up in Wikipedia] of this base
oligarchy they are all absorbed, sunk, and lost forever.

One might be tempted to think that some great offences in
France must cry to heaven, which has thought ﬁt to punish
it by subjecting it to a vile and inglorious domination in
which no comfort or compensation is to be found in any
of those false ‘splendours’ that prevent mankind from feel-
ing themselves dishonoured even while they are oppressed.
I must confess I am touched with a sorrow, mixed with some
indignation, at the conduct of a few men—once of great
rank and still of great character—who. . . .have engaged in a
business too deep for the lead-line of their understanding to
fathom; who have lent their fair reputation and the authority
of their high-sounding titles to the designs of men with whom
they could not be acquainted, and have thereby made their
very virtues operate to the ruin of their country.

So much for the ﬁrst cementing principle.

Cement 2: the power of Paris

The second material of cement for their new republic is the
superiority of the city of Paris, which is indeed strongly
connected with the other cementing principle of paper cir-
culation and conﬁscation. It is in this part of the project
that we must look for the cause of the destruction of all the

106

Reﬂections on the Revolution in France

Edmund Burke

Part 3

old boundaries of provinces and jurisdictions, ecclesiastical
and secular, and the dissolution of all ancient combina-
tions of things, as well as the formation of so many small
unconnected republics. The power of the city of Paris is
evidently one great spring of all their politics. It is through
the power of Paris, now become the centre and focus of
jobbing, that the leaders of this faction command the whole
legislative and the whole executive government. Everything,
therefore, must be done that can conﬁrm the authority of
that city over the other republics. Paris is compact; she
has an enormous strength, vastly greater than that of any
of the square republics; and this strength is collected and
condensed within a small area. [To understand the phrase ‘square
republics’ see paragraph (1) on page 95.] Paris has a natural and
easy connection among its parts, which will not be affected
by any scheme of a geometrical constitution; and it does
not matter much whether its proportion of representation
is more or less, because it has the whole draft of ﬁshes
in its dragnet, ·i.e. in the National Assembly·. The other
divisions of the kingdom, being hacked and torn to pieces
and separated from all their habitual means and principles
of union, cannot in the mean time unite against her. Nothing
was to be left in all the subordinate divisions but weakness,
disconnection, and confusion. To conﬁrm this part of the
plan the Assembly has recently resolved that no two of their
republics shall have the same commander-in-chief.

To a person who takes a view of the whole, this ‘strength’
that Paris has will appear to be a system of general weakness.
It is boasted that the geometrical policy has been adopted,
that all local ideas should be sunk, and that the people
should no longer be Gascons, Picards, Bretons, Normans,
but Frenchmen with one country, one heart, and one Assem-
bly. But instead of being all Frenchmen, the inhabitants
of that region are more likely soon to have no country. No

man was ever attached by a sense of pride, partiality, or real
affection to a description of square measurement. He never
will glory in belonging to ‘Chequer no. 71’ or to any other
badge-ticket. We begin our public affections in our families.
(No-one who is cold in his family relationships is a zealous
citizen.) We pass on to our neighbourhoods and our habitual
provincial connections. These are inns and resting places.
Such divisions of our country as have been formed by habit,
and not by a sudden jerk of authority, were so many little
images of the great country in which the heart found some-
thing it could ﬁll. Love for the whole is not extinguished by
this subordinate partiality. Perhaps it is a sort of elemental
training for those higher and broader concerns that men
come to have for the prosperity of a kingdom as extensive
as France. Citizens’ caring about that general territory itself,
as about former provinces, comes from old prejudices and
unreasoned habits and not from the geometric properties
of its shape! The power and pre-eminence of Paris does
certainly press down and hold these republics together as
long as it lasts. But, for the reasons I have already given you,
I think it cannot last very long.

Passing from the civil-creating and civil-cementing princi-
ples of this constitution to the National Assembly, which is to
appear and act as sovereign, we see a body in its constitution
with every possible power and no possible external control.
We see a body that has no fundamental laws, no established
maxims, no respected rules of proceeding, a body that
nothing can keep ﬁrm to any system whatsoever. Their
idea of their powers is always taken at the utmost stretch of
legislative competence, and their examples for ordinary cases
come from the exceptions of the most urgent necessity. The
future is to be in most respects like the present Assembly;
but. . . .it will soon be purged of the small degree of internal
control existing in a minority chosen originally from various

107

interests, and preserving something of their spirit. If possible,
the next Assembly must be worse than the present one. The
latter, by destroying and altering everything, will leave to
their successors apparently nothing popular to do. They will
be roused by emulation and example to bold and absurd
enterprises. To suppose such an Assembly sitting in perfect
quietude is ridiculous.

Your all-sufﬁcient legislators, in their hurry to do every-
thing at once, have forgotten one thing that seems essential,
and which I believe never has been before, in the theory or
the practice, omitted by any projector of a republic. They
have forgotten to constitute a senate or something of that
nature and character. Never before this time was heard of a
body politic composed of one legislative and active assembly,
and its executive ofﬁcers, without such a council, without
something to which foreign states might connect themselves;
something to which, in the ordinary detail of government,
the people could look up; something which might give a bias
and steadiness, and preserve something like consistency in
the proceedings of state. Kings generally have such a body
as a council. A monarchy may exist without it, but it seems
to be in the very essence of a republican government.
It
holds a sort of middle place between the supreme power
exercised by the people, or immediately delegated from them,
and the mere executive. Of this there are no traces in
your constitution, and in providing nothing of this kind
your Solons and Numas have, as much as in anything else,
revealed a sovereign incapacity.

(ii) Forming an executive power

[The ‘(ii)’ in that heading refers back to the numbered list of topics on
page 94]. Let us now turn our eyes to what they have done
toward the formation of an executive power. For this they

have chosen a downgraded king. This ﬁrst executive ofﬁcer
of theirs is to be a machine without any sort of deliberative
discretion in any one act of his function. At best he is but
a channel to convey to the National Assembly such facts
as that body may need to know.
If he had been made
the exclusive channel, the power would have had some
importance, though it would have been inﬁnitely perilous
to those who chose to exercise it. But public intelligence
and statements of facts can reach the Assembly with equal
authenticity by any other route. So the king’s ofﬁce of
providing intelligence is insigniﬁcant.

I shall consider the French scheme of an executive ofﬁcer

in its two natural divisions—(a) civil and (b) political.

(a) According to the new constitution, the higher parts
of judicature. . . .are not in the king. The king of France is
not the fountain of justice. He does not nominate either the
lower-court or the appellate judges. He neither proposes the
candidates, nor has a negative on the choice. He is not even
the public prosecutor. He serves only as a notary to authen-
ticate the choice made of the judges in the several districts.
By his ofﬁcers he is to carry out their sentence. When we
look into the true nature of his authority, he appears to be
nothing more than a chief of debt-collectors, sergeants at
mace, tax-collectors, gaolers, and hangmen. It is impossible
to place anything called ‘royalty’ in a more degrading position.
It would have been a thousand times better for the dignity
of this unhappy prince if he had nothing at all to do with
the administration of justice, given that he is deprived of all
that is venerable and all that is consolatory in that function,
without power of originating any process, without a power
of suspension, mitigation, or pardon. Everything in justice
that is vile and odious is thrown upon him. . . . It would be
unnatural for the king of the French, situated as he now is,
to respect himself or be respected by others.

(b) Consider this new executive ofﬁcer on the side of
his political capacity, as he acts under the orders of the
National Assembly. To apply laws is a royal ofﬁce; to carry
out orders is not to be a king. Still, a political executive
magistracy—even if that is all it is—is a great trust.
It
is a trust indeed that has much depending on its faithful
and diligent performance, both in the person presiding in it
and in all his subordinates. Means of performing this duty
ought to be given by regulation; and dispositions toward
it ought to be infused by the circumstances attendant on
the trust. It ought to be environed with dignity, authority,
and consideration, and it ought to lead to glory. . . . What
sort of person is a king to command executive service when
he has no means to reward it? Not in a permanent ofﬁce;
not in a grant of land; no, not in a pension of £50 a year;
not in the vainest and most trivial title. In France, the king
is no more the fountain of honour than he is the fountain
of justice. All rewards, all distinctions are in other hands.
Those who serve the king can be driven by no natural motive
except fear—by a fear of everything except their master. His
functions of internal coercion are as odious as the ones he
exercises in the department of justice. If relief is to be given
to any municipality, the Assembly gives it. If troops are to be
sent to reduce them to obedience to the Assembly, the king
is to carry out the order; and on every occasion he is to be
spattered with the blood of his people. He has no negative;
yet his name and authority is used to enforce every harsh
decree. He must even concur in the butchery of anyone who
tries to free him from his imprisonment or show the slightest
attachment to his person or to his former authority.

Executive magistracy ought to be constituted in such a
way that those who compose it should be disposed to love
and to venerate those whom they are bound to obey. The
wisest counsels ·or commands· can be ruined by deliberate

neglect or (worse) by literal obedience that is perverse and
malignant. In vain will the law attempt to anticipate or to
follow such studied neglects and fraudulent attentions. To
make subordinates act zealously is not in the competence
of law. Kings, even ones who really are kings, can and
ought to bear the •freedom of subjects who are obnoxious to
them. They can even, without derogating from themselves,
bear the •authority of such persons if it promotes their
service. Louis XIII had a mortal hatred of the Cardinal
de Richelieu, but his support of that minister against his
rivals was the source of all the glory of his reign and the
solid foundation of his throne itself. Louis XIV did not love
the Cardinal Mazarin, but for his interests he preserved
him in power. . . . But these ministers, who were chosen by
affairs and not by affections, acted in the name of kings and
in trust for them, not as their avowed, constitutional, and
ostensible masters. I think it impossible that any king, when
he has recovered his ﬁrst terrors, can cordially infuse vivacity
and vigour into measures that he knows to be dictated by
people who (he must be sure) are in the highest degree
antagonistic to his person. Will any ministers who serve
such a king (or whatever he may be called) with merely a
decent appearance of respect happily obey the orders of
people whom they had recently committed to the Bastille
in his name?. . . . If you expect such obedience among your
other innovations and regenerations, you ought to make a
revolution in nature and provide a new constitution for the
human mind! Otherwise, your supreme government cannot
harmonise with its executive system. There are cases in
which we cannot take up with names and abstractions. You
may call half a dozen leading individuals whom we have
reason to fear and hate ‘the nation’. It makes no difference
except to make us fear and hate them more. If it had been
thought justiﬁable and expedient to make such a revolution

109

Part 3

by such means and through such persons as you have made
yours, it would have been wiser to complete the business
of the ﬁfth and sixth of October ·by removing the King from
the picture entirely·. The new executive ofﬁcer would then
owe his situation to those who are his creators as well as his
masters, and he might be bound in. . . .in gratitude to serve
those who had promoted him to a place of great wealth and
great sensual indulgence. . . .

A king in circumstances like those of the present king
of France, if he is so totally stupeﬁed by his misfortunes
that he thinks it the premium and privilege of life to eat and
sleep without any regard to glory, can never be ﬁt for the
ofﬁce. If he feels as men commonly feel, he must be aware
that an ofﬁce in such circumstances is one in which he
can obtain no fame or reputation. He has no warm-hearted
interest that can excite him to action. At best, his conduct
will be passive and defensive. To inferior people such an
ofﬁce might be matter of honour. But being raised to it
is different from descending to it, and suggests different
sentiments. If he really names the ministers, they will have
a sympathy with him. If they are forced on him, the whole
business between them and the nominal king will be mutual
counteraction. In all other countries, the ofﬁce of ministers
of state is of the highest dignity. In France it is full of peril
and incapable of glory. Yet ministers in France will have
rivals in their nothingness, while shallow ambition exists in
the world or the desire for a miserable salary is an incentive
to short-sighted avarice. Your constitution enables those
competitors of the ministers to attack them in their vital
parts, while they have no means of repelling their charges
except in the degrading character of culprits. The ministers
of state in France are the only persons in that country
who cannot have a share in the national councils. What
ministers! What councils! What a nation! —‘But they are

responsible.’
It is a poor service that is to be had from
responsibility. The elevation of mind to be derived from fear
will never make a nation glorious. Responsibility prevents
crimes. It makes all attempts against the laws dangerous.
But only idiots could think of responsibility as a principle
[see Glossary] of active and zealous service. Is the conduct of a
war to be entrusted to a man who may abhor its principle,
whose every step to make it successful conﬁrms the power of
those by whom he is oppressed? Will foreign states seriously
treat with him who has no prerogative of peace or war? No,
not so much as in a single vote by himself or his ministers,
or by anyone he can possibly inﬂuence. A state of contempt
is not a state for a prince; better get rid of him at once.

I know it will be said that these feelings and attitudes
in the court and executive government will continue only
through this generation, and that the king has been brought
to declare the dauphin [his oldest son] will be educated in
conformity to his situation.
If he is made to conform to
his situation, he will have no education at all! His training
will be even worse than that of an arbitrary monarch. If he
reads, some good or evil genius will tell him his ancestors
were kings, and from then on his objective must be to assert
himself and to avenge his parents. This you will say is not
his duty. That may be; but it is nature; and while you turn
nature against you, you do unwisely to trust to duty. In this
futile scheme of polity, the state now nurses in its bosom a
source of weakness, perplexity, counteraction, inefﬁciency,
and decay; and it prepares the means of its ﬁnal ruin. In
short, I see nothing in the executive force (I cannot call it
‘authority’) that has even an appearance of vigour, or that has
the smallest degree of suitable correspondence or symmetry
or amicable relation with the supreme power, either as it
now exists or as it is planned for the future government.

You have settled, by an economy as perverted as the
policy, two establishments of government—one real, one
ﬁctitious. Both maintained at a vast expense, the cost of
the ﬁctitious one being greater, I think. Such a machine as
the latter is not worth the grease of its wheels. The expense
is exorbitant, and neither the •show nor the •use deserve a
tenth part of the charge.

‘Oh! but you don’t do justice to the talents of the leg-
islators; you don’t allow, as you should, for necessity.
Their scheme of executive force was not their choice.
This pageant must be kept. The people would not
consent to part with it.’

Right; I understand you. In spite of your grand theories, to
which you would have heaven and earth to bend, you do
know how to conform yourselves to the nature and circum-
stances of things. But when you were obliged to conform
thus far to circumstances, you ought to have carried your
submission further and to have made a proper instrument
that would be useful for its purposes. That was in your power.
For instance, among many other options, it was in your
power to leave to your king the right of peace and war. What!
to leave to the executive magistrate the most dangerous
of all prerogatives? I know of none more dangerous, nor
any more necessary to be so trusted.
I do not say that
this prerogative ought to be trusted to your king unless
he enjoyed other auxiliary trusts along with it, which he
does not now have. But if he did possess them, hazardous
as they undoubtedly are, such a constitution would have
advantages more than compensating for the risk. There is
no other way of keeping the various potentates of Europe
from intriguing separately and personally with the members
of your Assembly, intermeddling in all your concerns, and
fomenting in the heart of your country the most pernicious
of all factions—ones serving the interests and under the

direction of foreign powers. From that worst of evils, thank
God, we ·in Great Britain· are still free. Your skill, if you
had any, would be well employed ﬁnding indirect correctives
and controls upon this perilous trust. If you did not like the
ones we in England have chosen, your leaders might have
exercised their abilities in designing something better. . . .

I hear that the persons who are called ministers have
signiﬁed an intention of resigning their places. I am aston-
ished that they did not resign long ago. The situation they
have been in for the past year is one I wouldn’t have stood
in for all the world. They wished well, I take it for granted,
to the revolution. Be that as it may, they were placed on
a height—though a height of humiliation—from which they
must have seen. . . .the evils that have been produced by
that revolution. In every step they took or forbore to take
they must have felt the degraded situation of their country
and their utter inability to serve it. They are in a kind
of subordinate servitude that has no precedent in history.
Without conﬁdence from their sovereign, on whom they were
forced, or from the Assembly, who forced them on him, all the
noble functions of their ofﬁce are performed by committees
of the Assembly without any regard for their personal or
their ofﬁcial authority. They are to execute, without power;
they are to be responsible, without discretion; they are to
deliberate, without choice. In their puzzled situations, under
two sovereigns with no inﬂuence on either, they must act in
such a way that (whatever they may intend) they sometimes
betray the one, sometimes the other, and always betray
themselves. Such has been their situation, such must be
the situation of those who follow them. . . .

The abolition of the parlements

I can see as little genius and talent in the plan of judicature
formed by the National Assembly ·as I see in its other plans·.
According to their invariable course, the framers of your con-
stitution began by utterly abolishing the parlements. These
venerable bodies, like the rest of the old government, needed
to be reformed whether or not there was any change in the
monarchy. . . . But a good many features of their constitution
deserved approval from the wise. They had one fundamental
excellence:
they were independent. The most doubtful
feature of their ofﬁce, namely its being something that could
be bought and sold, contributed to this independence of
character. They held for life. Indeed, they may be said to have
held by inheritance. Appointed by the monarch, they were
considered as nearly out of his power. The most determined
exertions of the monarch against them only showed their
radical independence. They composed permanent political
bodies, constituted to resist arbitrary innovation; and from
that corporate constitution, and from most of their forms,
they were well calculated to afford both certainty and stability
to the laws. They were a safe asylum to secure these laws in
all the ups and downs of mood and opinion. They saved that
sacred deposit of the country—·its laws·—during the reigns
of arbitrary princes and the struggles of arbitrary factions.
They kept alive the memory and record of the constitution.
They were the great security to private property which might
be said (when personal liberty had no existence) to be as
well guarded in France as in any other country. Whatever
is supreme in a state ought to have, as far as possible, its
judicial authority so constituted as not only not to depend on
it but in some way to balance it. It ought to give a security to
its justice against its power. It ought to make its judicature,
as it were, something exterior to the state.

These parlements had provided (not the best, but) some
corrective to the monarchy’s excesses and vices. Such an
independent judicature was much more necessary when a
democracy became the absolute power of the country. In
that constitution what you have contrived—elective, tempo-
rary, local judges, exercising their dependent functions in
a narrow society—is the worst of all tribunals.
It will be
vain to look to them for any appearance of justice toward
strangers, toward the obnoxious rich, toward the minority
of routed parties, toward all those who in the election have
supported unsuccessful candidates. It will be impossible to
keep the new tribunals clear of the worst spirit of faction. All
contrivances by ballot we know from experience to be vain
and childish to prevent a discovery of inclinations. Where
they do produce concealment they also produce suspicion,
and this is a still more harmful cause of partiality.

If the parlements had been preserved, instead of being
dissolved at such a ruinous cost to the nation, they could
have served in this new commonwealth in roughly the same
way that the court and senate of Areopagus served in Athens;
namely as one of the balances and correctives to the evils
of a light and unjust democracy. Everyone knows that this
tribunal was the great stay of that state; everyone knows
how carefully it was upheld, and with what a religious awe
it was consecrated. The parlements ·in France· were not
wholly free from faction, I admit; but this evil was exterior
and accidental, not an inevitable result of their constitution,
which is what it must be in your new contrivance of elected
tribunals with six-year terms. Several English writers com-
mend the abolition of the old tribunals, supposing that they
determined everything by bribery and corruption. But they
have stood the test of monarchic and republican scrutiny.
The court was well disposed to prove them to be corrupt
when they were dissolved in 1771. Those who have again

112

Reﬂections on the Revolution in France

Edmund Burke

Part 3

dissolved them would have done the same if they could,
but both inquisitions having failed, I conclude that gross
pecuniary corruption must have been rare among them.

It would have been prudent, along with the parlements,
to preserve their ancient power of critical commentary on all
the decrees of the National Assembly, as they did upon those
that passed in the time of the monarchy. This would be a
means of squaring •the occasional decrees of a democracy
to •some principles of general jurisprudence. The vice of the
ancient democracies, and one cause of their ruin, was that
they (like you) ruled by occasional decrees. This practice
soon broke in on the tenor and consistency of the laws; it
lessened the people’s respect for them, and totally destroyed
them in the end.

You have given the power of critical commentary—which
in the time of the monarchy existed in the parliament of
Paris—to your principal executive ofﬁcer, whom you nonsen-
sically insist on calling ‘king’. This is the height of absurdity.
You ought never to permit critical commentary from him
who is to execute. This is to understand neither council
nor execution, neither authority nor obedience. The person
whom you call ‘king’ ought not to have this power, or he ought
to have more. [In the preceding two paragraphs ‘critical commentary’
replaces Burke’s ‘remonstrance’.]

(iii) The judicature

[The ‘(iii)’ in that heading refers back to the numbered list of topics
on page 94]. Your present arrangement is strictly judicial.
Instead of imitating your monarchy and seating your judges
on a bench of independence, you aim to reduce them to
the most blind obedience. As you have changed all things,
you have invented new principles of order. You ﬁrst appoint
judges who (I suppose) are to determine according to law,

and then you let them know that you will eventually give
them some law by which to determine. Any studies they
have made (if they have made any) will be useless to them.
But to ﬁll the place of these studies they are to be sworn to
obey all the rules, orders, and instructions they receive from
the National Assembly. If they submit to these they leave
no ground of law to the subject. They become complete and
most dangerous instruments in the hands of the governing
power which can wholly change the rules in the middle of
a cause or in preparation for one.
If these orders of the
National Assembly come to be contrary to the will of the
people, who locally choose judges, dreadful confusion must
occur. For the judges owe their places to the local authority,
and the commands they are sworn to obey come from those
who have no share in their appointment. . . .

The Assembly promises to create a body of law that will be
short, simple, clear, and so forth. That is, by their short laws
they will leave much to the discretion of the judge, while they
have exploded the authority of all the learning which could
make judicial discretion (a perilous thing at best!) deserve to
count as sound discretion.

Oddly, the administrative bodies are carefully exempted
from the jurisdiction of these new tribunals. That is, the
persons who ought to be the most entirely submitted to the
laws are exempted from their power. Those who carry out
public pecuniary trusts ought of all men to be the most
strictly held to their duty. Given that you did not mean those
administrative bodies to be real, sovereign, independent
states, one would have thought that it must have been one
of your ﬁrst concerns to form an awe-inspiring tribunal—like
your late parlements, or like our King’s Bench—where all cor-
porate ofﬁcers could •obtain protection in the legal exercise
of their functions, and would •ﬁnd coercion if they trespassed
against their legal duty. But the cause of the exemption is

113

Reﬂections on the Revolution in France

Edmund Burke

Part 3

plain. These administrative bodies are the great instruments
of the present leaders in their march through democracy to
oligarchy, so they must be put above the law. . . .

This establishment of judges still lacks something for its
completion.
It is to be crowned by a new tribunal. This
is to be a grand state judicature, and it is to judge crimes
committed against the nation, i.e. against the power of the
Assembly. They seem to have been aiming at something
like the high court of justice erected in England during the
time of the great usurpation ·by Cromwell·. As they have
not yet ﬁnished this part of the scheme, it is impossible
to form a right judgment on it. But if they don’t take care
to form it in a spirit very different from what has guided
them in their proceedings relative to state offences, this
tribunal—subservient to their inquisition, the ‘Committee of
Research’—will extinguish the last sparks of liberty in France
and establish the most dreadful and arbitrary tyranny ever
known in any nation. If they want to give this tribunal any
appearance of liberty and justice, they must not send to it
causes involving their own members; and they must move
the seat of that tribunal out of the republic of Paris.

(iv) The army

Has more wisdom been displayed in the constitution of your
army than what we ﬁnd in your plan of judicature? The able
arrangement of this part is harder and more demanding of
skill and attention, not only as of great concern in itself but
also—·referring back to page 103·—as the third cementing
principle in the new body of republics that you call the
French nation.
It is not easy to foresee what that army
may eventually become. You have voted a very large one,
well equipped, at least fully equal to your apparent means
of payment. But what is the principle of its discipline? or

whom is it to obey? You have got the wolf by the ears, and I
wish you joy of the happy position in which you have chosen
to place yourselves, and in which you are well positioned
for a free deliberation concerning that army or concerning
anything else.

The minister and secretary of state for the war department
is M. de la Tour du Pin. This gentleman, like his colleagues in
administration, is a most zealous assertor of the revolution,
and an optimistic admirer of the new constitution that
originated in that event. His statement of facts about the
military of France is important not only because of his ofﬁcial
and personal authority, but also because it clearly displays
the actual condition of the army in France, and it throws
light on the principles on which the Assembly proceeds in
the administration of this critical object. It may enable us
to form some judgment about how far we in Great Britain
should imitate the military policy of France.

M. de la Tour du Pin, on the fourth of last June, comes
to give an account of the state of his department as it exists
under the auspices of the National Assembly. No man knows
it so well; no man can express it better. Addressing himself
to the National Assembly, he says:

‘His Majesty has this day sent me to inform you of the
multiplied disorders of which every day he receives
the most distressing intelligence. The army threatens
to fall into the most turbulent anarchy. Entire regi-
ments have dared to violate the respect due to •the
laws, •the king, •the order established by your decrees,
and •the oaths they have taken with the most awful
solemnity. Compelled by my duty to inform you of
these excesses, my heart bleeds when I consider who
they are that have committed them. Those against
whom it is not in my power to withhold the most
grievous complaints are a part of that very soldiery

114

Reﬂections on the Revolution in France

Edmund Burke

Part 3

which to this day have been so full of honour and
loyalty, and with whom I have lived as comrade and
friend for ﬁfty years.

‘What incomprehensible spirit of delirium and
delusion has all at once led them astray? While you
are tirelessly establishing uniformity in the empire,
and molding the whole into one coherent and consis-
tent body, while the French are taught by you the
respect that the laws owe to the rights of man and
that the citizens owe to the laws, the administration
of the army presents nothing but disturbance and
confusion. I see in more than one corps the bonds
of discipline relaxed or broken; the most unheard-of
pretensions avowed directly and without any disguise;
the ordinances without force; the chiefs without au-
thority; the military chest and the colours carried off;
the authority of the king himself proudly deﬁed; the
ofﬁcers despised, degraded, threatened, driven away,
and some of them prisoners in the midst of their corps,
dragging on a precarious life in the bosom of disgust
and humiliation. . . . The commandants of places have
had their throats cut, under the eyes and almost in
the arms of their own soldiers.

‘These evils are great; but they are not the worst
consequences that can come from such military insur-
rections. Sooner or later they may menace the nation
itself. The nature of things requires that the army
should never act but as an instrument. The moment it
sets itself up as a deliberative and acts according
to its own resolutions, the government, be it what
it may, will immediately degenerate into a military
democracy—a species of political monster that has
always ended by devouring those who produced it.

‘After all this, who can not be alarmed at the
irregular consultations and turbulent committees
formed in some regiments by the common soldiers and
non-commissioned ofﬁcers without the knowledge of
their superiors and even in contempt of their authority.
Not that the agreement of those superiors could give
authority to such monstrous democratic assemblies.’
It is not necessary to add much to this ﬁnished picture—
ﬁnished as far as its canvas admits, but not (I think) taking
in the whole of the nature and complexity of the disorders
of this military democracy which, as the minister of war
truly and wisely observes, must be the true constitution
of the state, whatever ofﬁcial label it is given. For though
he informs the Assembly that the more considerable part
of the army have not cast off their obedience and are still
attached to their duty, travellers who have seen the corps
whose conduct is the best observe in them •the absence of
mutiny rather than •the existence of discipline.

I cannot help pausing here to reﬂect on this minister’s
surprise which over the excesses he relates. To him it seems
quite inconceivable that the troops should depart from their
ancient principles of loyalty and honour. Surely those he
is speaking to know the causes of this only too well. They
know the doctrines they have preached, the decrees they
have passed, the practices they have permitted. The soldiers
remember 6 October. They recollect the French guards.
They have not forgotten the taking of the king’s castles
in Paris and Marseilles, or the fact that the governors in
both places were murdered with impunity. They do not
abandon the principles of ‘the equality of men’ laid down
so ostentatiously and laboriously. They cannot shut their
eyes to the degradation of the whole nobility of France and
the suppression of the very idea of a gentleman. The total
abolition of titles and distinctions is not lost on them. But

115

Reﬂections on the Revolution in France

Edmund Burke

Part 3

M. de la Tour du Pin is astonished at their disloyalty when
the doctors of the Assembly have taught them—along with
all this—the respect due to laws. It is easy to judge which of
the two sorts of lessons men with weapons in their hands are
likely to learn! As for the authority of the king, we can learn
from the minister himself that it is of no more consideration
with these troops than it is with anyone else. ‘The king’, says
he, ‘has over and over again repeated his orders to put a
stop to these excesses; but in so terrible a crisis your (the
Assembly’s) concurrence has become necessary to prevent
the evils that menace the state. You unite to the force of the
legislative power that of opinion, still more important.’ To be
sure the army can have no opinion of the power or authority
of the king. Perhaps the soldier has by this time learned that
the Assembly itself does not enjoy much more liberty than
that royal ﬁgure.

It is now to be seen what has been proposed in this
exigency, one of the greatest that can happen in a state. The
minister asks the Assembly to array itself in all its terrors
and to call forth all its majesty. He desires that the grave
and severe principles announced by them may give vigour
to the king’s proclamation. [In the next sentence, ‘decimating’ a
military unit is executing one tenth of its members, chosen at random.]
After this we should have looked for civil and military courts,
the breaking of some corps, the decimating of others, and
all the terrible means which necessity has employed in such
cases to stop the progress of the most terrible of all evils;
particularly, one might expect that a serious inquiry would
be made into the murder of commandants in the view of their
soldiers. Not one word of all this or of anything like it! After
being told that the soldiery trampled on the decrees of the
Assembly promulgated by the king, the Assembly pass new
decrees and authorise the king to make new proclamations.
After the secretary at war had stated that the regiments

had paid no regard to oaths ‘taken with the most imposing
solemnity’, they propose—what? More oaths!. . . .

The means that have been used to prevent the mischiefs
arising from conspiracies, irregular consultations, seditious
committees, and monstrous democratic assemblies of the
soldiers, and all the disorders arising from idleness, luxury,
dissipation, and insubordination, are (I believe) the most
astonishing that ever occurred to men, even in all the
inventions of this proliﬁc age. It is no less than this: the king
has promulgated in circular letters to all the regiments his
direct authority and encouragement that the various corps
should join themselves with the clubs and confederations in
the several municipalities, and mix with them in their feasts
and civic entertainments! This jolly discipline, it seems, is
to soften the ferocity of their minds, to reconcile them to
their bottle companions of other descriptions, and to merge
particular conspiracies in more general associations. That
this remedy would be pleasing to the soldiers, as they are
described by M. de la Tour du Pin, I can readily believe; and
however mutinous they are otherwise I am sure they will
dutifully submit themselves to these royal proclamations.
But I question whether all this civic swearing, clubbing, and
feasting would make them more disposed than they are at
present to obey their ofﬁcers, or teach them better to submit
to the austere rules of military discipline. It will make them
admirable citizens in the French manner, but not quite so
good soldiers in any manner. We may well doubt whether
the conversations at these good tables would improve their
ﬁtness for the role of mere ‘instruments’, which this veteran
ofﬁcer and statesman rightly says the nature of things always
requires an army to be.

Concerning the likelihood of this improvement in dis-
cipline by the free conversation of the soldiers with mu-
nicipal festive societies we may judge by the state of the

municipalities themselves, provided to us by the war min-
ister in this very speech. The good disposition of certain
regiments gives him good hopes of the success of his endeav-
ours to restore order for the present, but he ﬁnds something
cloudy with regard to the future. As to preventing the
return of confusion, the administration (says he) cannot
be answerable to you (the Assembly) for this as long as they
see the municipalities claim for themselves an authority
over the troops that your institutions have reserved wholly
to the monarch. You have ﬁxed the limits of the military
authority and the municipal authority. You have limited the
action you have permitted to the latter over the former to the
right of requisition; neither the letter nor the spirit of your
decrees ever authorised the commons in these municipalities
to break the ofﬁcers, to try them, to give orders to the soldiers,
to drive them from the posts they had been ordered to guard,
to stop them in their marches ordered by the king, or, in a
word, to enslave the troops to the whims of each of the cities
or even market towns through which they are to pass.

[Burke now attacks the dismissive attitude of the Assem-
bly (‘juvenile politicians’) to age and experience (‘a man of
ﬁfty years’ wear and tear among mankind’). Then:]

The imbecility of any part of the puerile and pedantic
system that they call a ‘constitution’ cannot be laid open
without revealing the utter insufﬁciency and harmfulness
of every other part that bears even the remotest relation to
it. You cannot propose a remedy for the incompetence of
the crown without displaying the feebleness of the Assembly.
You cannot deliberate on the confusion of the army of the
state without disclosing the worse disorders of the armed
municipalities. . . . Read carefully the eloquent speech (such
it is) of M. de la Tour du Pin. He attributes the salvation of the
municipalities to the good behaviour of some of the troops.
These troops are to preserve the well-disposed part of those

municipalities, which is confessed to be the weakest, from
the pillage of the worst-disposed, which is the strongest. But
the municipalities claim sovereignty and want to command
the troops needed for their protection.
Indeed they must
command them or court them. Because of the demands of
their situation and the republican powers they have obtained,
the municipalities must relate to the military as

•masters, or
•servants, or
•confederates, or
•each in turn,

or they must make a jumble of all together, according to
circumstances. What government is there to coerce the army
except the municipality, or to coerce the municipality except
the army? To preserve concord where authority is extin-
guished, at the risk of all consequences, the Assembly tries
to cure the illnesses by the illnesses themselves: they hope
to preserve themselves from a purely military democracy by
giving the military a debauched interest in the municipal
democracy.

Once the soldiers come to mix for any time in the munici-
pal clubs, cabals, and confederacies, a magnetic attraction
will draw them to the lowest and most desperate part, bring-
ing with them their habits, affections, and sympathies. The
military conspiracies, which are to be remedied by civic
confederacies; the rebellious municipalities, which are to be
made obedient by providing them with the means of seducing
the very armies of the state that are to keep them in order; all
these chimeras of a monstrous and portentous policy must
worsen the confusion from which they have arisen. There
must be blood. The lack of common judgment manifested
in the construction of all their descriptions [see Glossary] of
forces and in all their kinds of civil and judicial authorities
will make it ﬂow. Disorders may be quieted in one time

117

and in one part. They will break out in others, because
the evil is radical and intrinsic. All these schemes of mix-
ing mutinous soldiers with seditious citizens must further
•weaken the military connection of soldiers with their ofﬁcers,
while •adding military and mutinous audacity to turbulent
craftsmen and peasants. To secure a real army, the ofﬁcer
should be ﬁrst and last in the eye of the soldier; ﬁrst and last
in his attention, observance, and esteem. ·In your ‘army’·
it seems there are to be ofﬁcers whose chief qualiﬁcation
is calmness and patience. They are to manage their troops
by electioneering arts. They must conduct themselves as
candidates, not as commanders. By such means power may
be occasionally in their hands, so the authority by which
they are to be nominated becomes of high importance.

Control of the army

It is not clear what you will ﬁnally do; and it does not matter
much while the strange and contradictory relation between
your army and all the parts of your republic, as well as the
puzzled relation of those parts to each other and to the whole,
remain as they are. You seem to have given the provisional
nomination of the ofﬁcers in the ﬁrst instance to the king,
subject to approval by the National Assembly. Men who have
an interest to pursue are extremely good at discovering the
true seat of power. They must soon perceive that those who
can block appointments indeﬁnitely are really appointing.
So the ofﬁcers must look to their intrigues in that Assembly
as the only sure road to promotion. Yet by by your new
constitution they must begin their solicitation at court. This
double negotiation for military rank seems to me likely to
promote faction in the Assembly itself relating to this vast
military patronage, and then to poison the corps of ofﬁcers
with factions of a nature still more dangerous to the safety

of government. . . .and destructive in the end to the efﬁciency
of the army itself. If the system were designed for just that
purpose it couldn’t have been better done. Ofﬁcers who
lose the promotions intended for them by the crown must
become of a faction opposed to that of the Assembly that
has rejected their claims, and must nourish in the heart
of the army discontents against the ruling powers. On the
other hand, ofﬁcers who, by carrying their point through
an interest in the Assembly feel themselves to be at best
only second in the good will of the crown though ﬁrst in that
of the Assembly, must slight an authority that would not
advance and could not retard their promotion. If to avoid
these evils you decide that command and promotion are to
be decided purely by seniority, you will have an army of
formality; at the same time it will become more independent
·of any external control· and more of a military republic. . . .
A king is not to be deposed by halves. If he is not everything
in the command of an army, he is nothing. What is the effect
of a power placed nominally in the hands of a ‘head’ of the
army whom that army is not grateful to or afraid of? Such
a ﬁgurehead is not ﬁt for the administration of something
that is of all things the most delicate, namely the supreme
command of military men. They must be constrained. . . .by
a real, vigorous, effective, decided, personal authority. The
authority of the Assembly itself suffers by passing through
such a debilitating channel as they have chosen. The army
will not long look to an assembly that acts through false
show and palpable imposition. They will not seriously yield
obedience to a prisoner. They will either despise the pageant
or pity the captive king. This relation of your army to
the crown will, I think, become a serious dilemma in your
politics.

There is also the question of whether an assembly like
yours, even if it did have another sort of organ through

118

Reﬂections on the Revolution in France

Edmund Burke

Part 3

which to pass its orders, is ﬁt for promoting the obedience
and discipline of an army.
It is known that armies have
always given a very precarious and uncertain obedience to
any senate or popular authority; and least of all will they
yield it to an assembly that is to continue for only two years.
The ofﬁcers must totally lose the characteristic disposition
of military men if they see with perfect submission and due
admiration the dominance of orators; especially when they
ﬁnd that they have to pay court repeatedly to an endless
series of those orators, whose military policy and command
skills (if they have any) must be as uncertain as their dura-
tion is short. In the weakness of one kind of authority (·the
king·) and the ﬂuctuation of the other (·the Assembly·), the
ofﬁcers of an army will remain for some time mutinous and
quarrelsome until some popular general who •understands
the art of conciliating the soldiery and •possesses the true
spirit of command draws the eyes of all men onto himself.
Armies will obey him because of his personal qualities. There
is no other way of securing military obedience in this state of
things. But the moment that event happens, this person who
really commands the army is your master—the master of
your king, your Assembly, your whole republic. [This event did
happen nine years later with the ascendancy of Napoleon Bonaparte.]

How did the Assembly get their present power over the
army? Chieﬂy by seducing the soldiers away from their
ofﬁcers. They have begun by a most terrible operation. . . .
They have destroyed the principle of obedience in the great,
essential, critical link between the ofﬁcer and the soldier,
just where the chain of military subordination starts and on
which the whole of that system depends. The soldier is told
he is a citizen and has the rights of man and citizen. The right
of a man, he is told, is to be his own governor and to be ruled
only by those to whom he delegates that self-government. It
is very natural for him to think that he ought most of all to

have his choice where he is to yield the greatest degree of
obedience. So he will probably do systematically what he
now does occasionally, namely exercise at least a negative
in the choice of his ofﬁcers. At present the ofﬁcers are only
permitted to have their positions, and only conditionally on
their good behaviour. In fact there have been many cases
where they were dismissed by their corps. Here is a second
negative on the king’s choice—one that is at least as effective
as the Assembly’s negative. The soldiers know already that
the National Assembly has seriously considered whether they
(the soldiers) ought to have the direct choice of all or some
proportion of their ofﬁcers. When such matters are under
discussion it is not unreasonable to expect them to favour
the opinion that is most favourable to their claims. They
will not bear to be seen as the army of an imprisoned king
while another army in the same country—one with whom
they are to feast and confederate—is to be considered as
the free army of a free constitution. They will cast their
eyes on the other and more permanent army; I mean the
municipal army. That corps, they well know, does actually
elect its own ofﬁcers. They may not be able to see the
reason why they are not allowed to elect a Marquis de la
Fayette (or whatever his new name is) of their own. If this
election of a commander-in-chief is a part of ‘the rights of
men’, why not of theirs? They see elective justices of peace,
elective judges, elective curates, elective bishops, elective
municipalities, and elective commanders of the Parisian
army—why should they alone be excluded? Are the brave
troops of France the only men in that nation who are not the
ﬁt judges of military merit and of the qualiﬁcations necessary
for a commander-in-chief? Do they, because they are paid
by the state, lose the rights of men? They are a part of that
nation themselves and contribute to that pay. And is not the
king, is not the National Assembly, and are not all who elect

119

Reﬂections on the Revolution in France

Part 3

the National Assembly, likewise paid? Instead of seeing all
these forfeit their rights because they receive a salary, they
see that in all these cases a salary is given for the exercise of
those rights. . . .

Coercing the peasants

With a government such as yours everything depends on the
army, for you have industriously destroyed all the opinions
and prejudices and (as far as you could) all the instincts
that support government. The moment any difference arises
between your National Assembly and any part of the nation,
you must resort to force, because nothing else is left to
you—or rather you have left nothing else to yourselves. The
report of your war minister tells you that the distribution
of the army is in a great measure made with a view of
internal coercion. You must rule by an army; and you
have infused into that army, as well as into the whole body
of the nation, principles which in time must disable you
in the use you plan to make of it. The king is to call
out troops to act against his people, when the world has
been told—and the assertion still rings in our ears—that
troops ought not to ﬁre on citizens. The colonies claim for
themselves an independent constitution and free trade; they
must be constrained by troops.
In what chapter of your
code of the rights of men can they read that it is a part of
the rights of men to have their commerce monopolised and
restrained for the beneﬁt of others? As the colonists rise
on you, the Negroes rise on them. Troops again—massacre,
torture, hanging! These are your rights of men! These are
the fruits of metaphysical declarations wantonly made and
shamefully retracted! Only the other day the farmers of land
in one of your provinces refused to pay some sort of rent
to the lord of the soil. In consequence of this, you decree

that the country people shall pay all rents and dues except
the ones you have abolished as grievances; and you order
the king to march troops against them if they refuse. You
lay down metaphysical propositions which imply universal
consequences, and then you try to limit logic by despotism.
The leaders of the present system tell them of their rights,
as men, to take fortresses, to murder guards, to seize kings
without the least appearance of authority even from the
Assembly. . . ., and yet these leaders order out the troops that
have acted in these very disorders, to coerce those who judge
by the principles and follow the examples that have been
guaranteed by the leaders’ own approval.

The leaders teach the people to abhor and reject all
feudality as the barbarism of tyranny, and they tell them
afterwards how much of that barbarous tyranny they are
to put up with patiently. They are extravagant in throwing
light on grievances, but the people ﬁnd them to be extremely
sparing when it comes to redress. [He goes into details in
support of his claim that the revolution’s system of ‘land
rents’ is thoroughly unjust.]

The peasants are probably descendants of ancient pro-
prietors, Romans or Gauls. But if they fail in any way in
the titles they claim on the principles of antiquaries and
lawyers, they retreat into the citadel of ‘the rights of men’.
There they ﬁnd that men are equal; and the earth—the kind
and even-handed mother of all—ought not to be monopolised
to support the pride and luxury of men who by nature are
•no better than themselves, and who if they don’t labour for
their bread are •worse. They ﬁnd that by the laws of nature
the occupant and subduer of the soil is its true proprietor;
that there is no prescription [see Glossary] against nature; that
any agreements made with the landlords during the time
of ‘slavery’ are only the effect of duress and force; and that
when the people re-entered into the rights of men those

120

Reﬂections on the Revolution in France

Part 3

agreements became as void as everything else that had been
settled under the prevalence of the old feudal and aristocratic
tyranny. They will tell you that they do not see how an idler
with a hat and a national cockade is any different from an
idler in a cowl or in a surplice. If you base the entitlement to
rents on succession and prescription, they will tell you—from
the speech of M. Camus, published for their information by
the National Assembly—that things that are wrong at the
outset cannot avail themselves of prescription; that the title
of these lords was vicious in its origin; and that force is at
least as bad as fraud. As for title by succession, they will tell
you that the succession of those who have cultivated the soil
is the true pedigree of property, and not rotten parchments
and silly substitutions; and that the lords have enjoyed their
usurpation too long. . . .

When the peasants give you back that coin of sophistical
reasoning on which you have set your image and superscrip-
tion, you dismiss it as counterfeit money and tell them in
future you will pay them with French guards, and dragoons,
and hussars. To punish them, you wield the second-hand
authority of a king who is only the instrument of destroying,
with no power to protect the people or himself. Through him
it seems you will make yourselves obeyed. They answer:

‘You have taught us that there are no gentlemen; which
of your principles teach us to bow to kings whom we have
not elected? We know without your teaching that lands were
given for the support of feudal dignities, feudal titles, and
feudal ofﬁces. When you took down the cause as a grievance,
why should the more grievous effect remain? As there are
now no hereditary honours and no distinguished families,
why are we taxed to maintain what you tell us ought not to
exist? You have sent down our old aristocratic landlords as
nothing but exactors under your authority. Have you tried
to make these your rent-gatherers worthy of our respect?

No. You have sent them to us with their arms reversed, their
shields broken, their impresses defaced—so unfeathered,
degraded, and metamorphosed that we no longer know
them. They are strangers to us. They do not even go by
the names of our former lords. Physically they may be the
same men, though we are not quite sure of that, on your
new philosophical doctrines of personal identity. In all other
respects they are totally changed. We do not see why we
don’t have as much right to refuse them their rents as you
have to cancel all their honours, titles, and distinctions.
We never commissioned you to do that; it is one of the
many instances of your assumption of undelegated power.
We see the burghers of Paris—through their clubs, mobs,
and national guards—directing you at their pleasure, and
giving to you as law something which under your authority
is passed on as law to us. Through you these burghers
dispose of the lives and fortunes of us all. Why should not
you attend as much to the desires of the working farmer
with regard to our rent (by which we are seriously affected)
as you do to the demands of these insolent townspeople
with regard to distinctions and titles of honour (by which
neither they nor we are affected at all)? But we ﬁnd you
paying more regard to their fancies than to our necessities.
Paying tribute to his equals—is that among the rights of
man? Before this measure of yours, we might have thought
we were not perfectly equal. We might have entertained some
old, habitual, unmeaning bias in favour of those landlords;
but you have wanted to destroy all respect to them—why else
would you have made the law that degrades them? You have
forbidden us to treat them with any of the old formalities of
respect, and now you send troops to sabre and bayonet us
into a submission to fear and force, which you did not allow
us to yield to the mild authority of opinion.’

Part 3

The basis for some of these arguments is horrid and
ridiculous to all rational ears, but to the politicians of
metaphysics who have opened schools for sophistry and
made establishments for anarchy it is solid and conclusive.
It is obvious that the leaders in the Assembly would not on
moral grounds have had the least scruple about cancelling
the rents along with the title and family ensigns. Doing
that would be following the principle of their reasonings
and completing the analogy of their conduct. But they
had newly acquired by conﬁscation a great body of landed
property. They had this commodity at market; and the
market would have been wholly destroyed if they were to
permit •the farmers to riot in the speculations with which
they so freely intoxicated •themselves. The only security
which property enjoys in any one of its descriptions is from
the interests of their rapacity with regard to some other. [That
sentence is exactly as Burke wrote it.] They have left nothing but
their own arbitrary pleasure to determine what property is
to be protected and what subverted.

Nor have they left any principle by which any of their
municipalities can be bound to obedience, or even consci-
entiously obliged not to separate from the whole to •become
independent or •connect itself with some other state. The
people of Lyons, it seems, recently refused to pay taxes.
Why should they not? What lawful authority is there left to
demand them? The king imposed some of them. The old
states, methodised by orders, settled the more ancient taxes.
They may say to the Assembly:

‘Who are you, who are not our kings or states that
we have elected, and do not proceed on the basis of
principles on which we have elected you?
And who are we, who see the taxes that you have
ordered to be paid, wholly rejected and that act of
disobedience afterwards ratiﬁed by yourselves—who

are we to •have no say in what taxes we ought or
ought not to pay, and to •be refused the powers whose
validity you have approved in others?’

To this the answer is We will send troops! This last reason of
kings is always the ﬁrst with your Assembly. This military aid
may serve for a time, while the impression of the increase of
pay remains and the vanity of being umpires in all disputes
is ﬂattered. But this weapon—·the army·—will snap short,
unfaithful to the hand that employs it. The Assembly keep a
school where, systematically and with unremitting persever-
ance, they teach principles and form regulations destructive
to all spirit of subordination, civil and military—and then
they expect to hold an anarchic people in obedience by means
of an anarchic army.

This national army, according to the new policy, is to be
counter-balanced by the municipal army. The latter, consid-
ered purely in itself, has a constitution that is much simpler
and in every respect less objectionable than that of the
national army. It is a mere democratic body, unconnected
with the crown or the kingdom; armed and trained and
ofﬁcered at the pleasure of the districts to which the corps
severally belong; and the personal service of the individuals
who compose it, or the payment in lieu of personal service,
is directed by the same authority. Nothing is more uniform.
But if it is considered in any relation to the crown, to the
National Assembly, to the public tribunals, or to the national
army, or considered in a view to any coherence or connection
between its parts, it seems a monster that can hardly fail to
terminate its confused movements in some great national
calamity. . . .

(v) The revolution’s handling of revenue

Having concluded my few remarks on the constitution of
(i) the supreme power, (ii) the executive, (iii) the judicature,
(iv) the military, and on the reciprocal relations of all these
establishments, I shall say something about the ability
shown by your legislators with regard to (v) the revenue.

The proceedings in relation to this matter show even fewer
traces of political judgment or ﬁnancial resource. When the
states [see Glossary] met, it seemed that the great objective was
to improve the system of revenue, to enlarge its collection, to
cleanse it of oppression and vexation, and to establish it on
the most solid footing. There were great expectations about
that throughout Europe. It was by this grand arrangement
that France was to stand or fall; and it became (very properly,
in my opinion) the test by which the skill and patriotism
of those who ruled in that Assembly would be tried. The
revenue of the state is the state. In effect, everything depends
on it, whether for support or for reformation. The dignity
of every occupation wholly depends on the quantity and
kind of virtue that can be exerted in it. All great qualities
of the mind that operate in public, and are not merely
suffering and passive, require force for their display;. . . .so
the revenue, which is the spring of all power, becomes in
its administration the sphere of every active virtue. Public
virtue is of a magniﬁcent and splendid nature, instituted for
great things and dealing with great concerns; so it requires
abundant scope and room, and cannot spread and grow
under conﬁnement and in tightened, narrow, and sordid
circumstances. It is only through the revenue that the body
politic can act in its true genius and character, and therefore
it will display just as much of •its collective virtue, and
of the virtue of those who move it and are (as it were) its
life and guiding principle, as it has •a just revenue.
It is

from the revenue that magnanimity, liberality, beneﬁcence,
fortitude, providence, and the tutelary protection of all
good arts derive their food and the growth of their organs.
And continence, self-denial, labour, vigilance, frugality, and
whatever else there is in which the mind shows itself above
mere appetite, are nowhere more in their proper element
than in the provision and distribution of public wealth. So
it is not without reason that the science of theoretical and
practical ﬁnance, which must call upon so many auxiliary
branches of knowledge, stands high in the estimation not
only of the ordinary sort but of the wisest and best men;
and as this science has grown with the progress of its object,
the prosperity and improvement of nations has generally
increased with the increase of their revenues; and they will
both continue to grow and ﬂourish as long as the balance
between •what is left to strengthen the efforts of individuals
and •what is collected for the common efforts of the state is
properly maintained, with the two being closely related to one
another. And perhaps it may be owing to the size of revenues
and the urgency of state necessities that old abuses in the
constitution of ﬁnances are discovered and their true nature
and rational theory comes to be more perfectly understood;
because a smaller revenue might have been more distressing
in one period than a far greater one is found to be in another,
even if the public/private proportion remained the same. In
this state of things, the French Assembly found something
in their revenues to preserve, secure, and wisely administer,
as well as something to cancel and alter. Though their proud
assumption might justify the severest tests, I shan’t hold
them to models of ideal perfection, and will judge them only
on the basis of what is the plain obvious duty of a common
ﬁnance minister.

The objects of a ﬁnancier are, then, to secure an ample
revenue, to impose it with judgment and equality, to employ

123

Reﬂections on the Revolution in France

Part 3

it economically, and when necessary to make use of credit,
to secure its foundations in that instance and always by
the clearness and candour of his proceedings, the exactness
of his calculations and the solidity of his funds. With this
in mind let us take a short and distinct view of the merits
and abilities of those in the National Assembly who have
undertaken the management of this arduous concern. I ﬁnd
in a report by M. Vernier from the committee of ﬁnances
dated 2 August of last year that the amount of the national
revenue as compared with its product before the Revolution,
far from having increased in their hands, was lessened by a
sum equal to £8,000,000 sterling, a reduction of considerably
more than 30%.

If this is the result of great ability, never surely was
ability displayed in a more distinguished manner or with so
powerful an effect. No common folly, no everyday incapacity,
no ordinary ofﬁcial negligence, even no ofﬁcial crime, no
corruption, no peculation, hardly any direct hostility which
we have seen in the modern world could in so short a time
have made so complete an overthrow of the ﬁnances and,
with them, of the strength of a great kingdom. . . .

The salt monopoly

As soon as the Assembly met, the sophisters and declaimers
began by decrying the previous constitution of the revenue
in many of its most essential branches, such as the public
monopoly of salt. They accused this, as truly as unwisely
[Burke’s phrase], with being badly designed, oppressive, and
partial. They were not satisﬁed with saying this in speeches
introducing some plan of reform; they declared it in a solemn
resolution, as it were judicially passing sentence on the
monopoly; and they dispersed this sentence throughout the
nation. At the time of this decree, they equally solemnly

ordered the same absurd, oppressive, and partial tax to
be paid until they could ﬁnd a revenue to replace it. The
consequence was inevitable. The provinces that had always
been exempted from this salt monopoly—some of them
charged with other perhaps equivalent contributions—were
totally disinclined to bear any part of the burden. . . . As for
the Assembly, occupied as it was with declaring and violating
the rights of men, and arranging for general confusion, it
had neither leisure nor capacity to contrive, nor authority
to enforce, any plan of any kind for replacing the tax or
equalising it, or compensating the provinces, or conducting
their minds to any scheme of accommodation with districts
that were to be relieved.

The people of the salt provinces, impatient under taxes,
damned by the authority that had directed their payment,
very soon found their patience exhausted. They thought
themselves to be as skillful in demolition as the Assembly
could be. They relieved themselves by throwing off the whole
burden. Animated by this example, each district, or part of a
district—judging of its own grievance by its own feeling, and
of its remedy by its own opinion—did as it pleased with other
taxes.

Other revenue attempts

[In this paragraph ‘(un)equal(ity)’ means ‘(un)fair(ness)’.] Now let us
see how they have conducted themselves in designing equal
impositions that are •proportioned to the means of the citi-
zens and •the least likely to lean heavily on the active capital
at work in generating the private wealth from which the
public fortune must be derived. In allowing various districts,
and various individuals in each district, to decide what
part of the old revenue to withhold, they were introducing—
instead of better principles of equality—a new inequality

124

Reﬂections on the Revolution in France

Edmund Burke

Part 3

of the most oppressive kind. Payments were regulated by
dispositions. The parts of the kingdom that were the most
submissive, the most orderly, or the most well-disposed
towards the commonwealth bore the whole burden of the
state. Nothing turns out to be as oppressive and unjust as a
feeble government. To ﬁll up all the deﬁciencies in the old
impositions and the new deﬁciencies of every kind that were
to be expected—what remained to a state without authority?
The National Assembly called for voluntary benevolence: for
a quarter of each citizen’s income, to be estimated on the
honour of the paying citizen. What they obtained in this
way. . . .was far from enough to meet their real needs, and
even further from their foolish expectations. Rational people
would have hoped for little from this tax disguised as benev-
olence— a tax weak, ineffective, and unequal; a tax by which
luxury, avarice, and selﬁshness were screened, and the load
thrown on productive capital, on integrity, generosity, and
public spirit; a tax of regulation on virtue. At length the mask
is thrown off, and they are now trying (with little success) to
exact their benevolence by force.

This benevolence, the rickety offspring of weakness, was
to be supported by another resource, the twin brother of
the same proliﬁc imbecility:
the failure of the patriotic
•contribution was to be made up for by patriotic •donations.
John Doe was to become security for Richard Roe. By this
scheme they took things that were worth a lot to the giver
and of comparatively small value to the receiver; they ruined
a number of trades; they pillaged the crown of its ornaments,
the churches of their plate, and the people of their personal
decorations. The invention of these juvenile pretenders to
liberty was really just a servile imitation of one of the poorest
resources of senile despotism. [Burke refers to attempts by
Louis XIV and then by Louis XV to get revenue by asking
citizens to donate their silverware to be melted down to make

coins. Neither attempt had much success. After making
elaborate fun of the Assembly’s resorting to ‘these toys
and playthings of ﬁnance’, he continues:] Whatever virtue
there may be in these devices, it is obvious that neither
the patriotic gifts nor the patriotic contribution can ever
again be resorted to. The resources of public folly are soon
exhausted. Indeed, their whole scheme of revenue is to make
somehow an appearance of a full reservoir for the hour, while
cutting off the springs and living fountains of permanent
supply. M. Necker’s recent account was clearly meant to be
favourable. He gives a ﬂattering view of the means of getting
through the year, but he naturally expresses some anxiety
concerning the following year. Instead of entering into the
grounds of this anxiety in order to prevent the prognosticated
evil by a proper foresight, the president of the Assembly gives
M. Necker a sort of friendly reprimand.

It is impossible to say for sure anything about their other
schemes of taxation, because they have not yet been imple-
mented; but nobody could think that they will ﬁll up any
perceptible part of the hole that the Assembly’s incompetence
has made in their revenues. At present the state of their
treasury sinks every day in cash [i.e. in metal money], and
swells in ﬁctitious representation [i.e. in paper money]. When
so little within or without is now found but paper, which
represents not afﬂuence but poverty, and is the creature not
of credit but of power, they imagine that our ﬂourishing state
in England is due to that bank-paper. In fact, the bank-paper
is due to

•the ﬂourishing condition of our commerce,
•the solidity of our credit, and
•the total exclusion of all idea of power from any part
of the transaction.

·As regards the third of those·, they forget that in England
not one shilling of paper money of any description is received

125

Reﬂections on the Revolution in France

Part 3

except by choice; that the whole ·mass of paper money· has
had its origin in cash actually deposited; and that if one
wants to convert any of it back into cash, this can be done
in an instant and without the smallest loss. Our paper is
of value in commerce because in has no standing in law. . . .
A creditor who is owed twenty shillings can ·legally· refuse
all the paper of the Bank of England. Nor is there among us
any public security that is enforced by authority. It is in fact
easy to show that our paper wealth, instead of lessening the
real coin, has a tendency to increase it; that instead of being
a substitute for money, it only facilitates its entry, its exit,
and its circulation; that it is the symbol of prosperity and
not the badge of distress. . . .

‘Well! but a lessening of extravagant expenses, and the
economy that has been introduced by the virtuous and
intelligent Assembly, make up for the losses sustained in the
receipt of revenue. In this at least they have fulﬁlled the duty
of a ﬁnancier.’ Have those who say so looked at the expenses
of the National Assembly itself, of the municipalities, of the
city of Paris, of the increased pay of the two armies, of the
new police, of the new judicatures? Have they even carefully
compared the present pension list with the previous one?
These politicians have been cruel, not economical. Com-
paring the expense of the former extravagant government
in relation to its revenues with the expenses of this new
system in relation to the state of its new treasury, I believe
the present will be found to be incompably more guilty.

Obtaining credit

It remains only to consider the proofs of ﬁnancial ability
provided by the present French managers when they have to
raise supplies on credit. Here I am a little at a stand, because
properly speaking they do not have any credit. The credit of

the previous government was indeed not the best, but they
could always command money on some terms, not only in
France but from most European countries where surplus
capital had accumulated; and the credit of that government
was improving daily. The establishment of a system of liberty
would naturally be expected to give it new strength; and so it
would have done if a system of liberty had been established.
What offers has this government of so-called ‘liberty’ had
from Holland, from Hamburg, from Switzerland, from Genoa,
from England for a dealing in their paper? Why should these
nations of commerce and economy enter into any pecuniary
[see Glossary] dealings with a people who attempt to reverse
the very nature of things, a people among whom they see
the debtor prescribing at the point of the bayonet how he
is to repay the creditor, discharging one of his engagements
with another, turning his very poverty into his resource and
paying his interest with his rags?

Their fanatical conﬁdence in the omnipotence of church
plunder has induced these philosophers to overlook all care
of the public estate. . . . These philosophical ﬁnanciers expect
this universal medicine made of church-extract to cure all
the evils of the state. These gentlemen perhaps do not believe
much the •miracles of piety, but they certainly have an
undoubting faith in the •prodigies of sacrilege.

•Is there a debt that presses them?—Issue assignats.
•Are compensations to be made. . . .to those whom they
have robbed of their freehold in their ofﬁce, or expelled
from their profession?—Assignats.
•Is a ﬂeet to be ﬁtted out?—Assignats.

If £16,000,000 worth of these assignats, forced on the people,
leave the state’s needs as urgent as ever, ‘Issue £30,000,000
of assignats’, says one; ‘Issue £80,000,000 more of assig-
nats’, says another. The only difference among their ﬁnancial
factions is on what quantity of assignats is to be imposed

126

Reﬂections on the Revolution in France

Part 3

on the suffering public. They are all professors of assignats.
Even those whose natural good sense and knowledge of
commerce, not obliterated by philosophy, provide decisive
arguments against this delusion conclude their arguments
by proposing the issuing of assignats. I suppose they must
talk of ‘assignats’, as no other language would be under-
stood. All experience of their inefﬁciency does not in the
least discourage them. Are the old assignats depreciated at
market?—What is the remedy? Issue new assignats. . . .

Who but the most desperate adventurers in philosophy
and ﬁnance could have thought of destroying the settled
revenue of the state, the sole security for the public credit,
in the hope of rebuilding it with the materials of conﬁscated
property? If, however, an excessive zeal for the state should
have led a pious and venerable prelate. . . .to pillage his own
order and—for the good of the church and people—to take
on himself the place of grand ﬁnancier of conﬁscation and
comptroller-general of sacrilege, he and his coadjutors were
in my opinion obliged to show by their subsequent conduct
that they knew something of the ofﬁce they assumed. When
they had resolved to appropriate to the public treasury a
certain portion of the landed property of their conquered
country, it was their business to render their bank a real
fund of credit, as far as such a bank was capable of becoming
so. [This paragraph is savagely sarcastic: ‘a pious and venerable prelate’
for Talleyrand, bishop of Autun;
‘grand ﬁnancier of conﬁscation and
comptroller-general of sacrilege’ for his ofﬁcial position in the govern-
ment; ‘their conquered country’ for France]

Establishing a current circulating credit on any land-
bank has always proved difﬁcult and has commonly ended
in bankruptcy. But when the Assembly were led through a
contempt of •moral principles to a deﬁance of •economic ones,
it might have been expected at least to do everything it could
to lessen this difﬁculty, to lighten this bankruptcy. It might

be expected that to render your land-bank tolerable, every
means would be adopted that could display openness and
candour in the statement of the security—everything that
could aid the recovery of the demand. The most favourable
way of looking at your situation likens it to that of a man
with a large landed estate that he wanted to dispose of for
the discharge of a debt and the supply of certain services.
Not being able instantly to sell, you wanted to mortgage.
What would a man with fair intentions and a commonly clear
understanding do in such circumstances? Ought he not ﬁrst
to ascertain the gross value of the estate, the costs of its
management and disposition, the encumbrances (perpetual
and temporary) of all kinds that affect it, and then—settling
a net surplus—calculate the fair value of the security? When
that surplus (the only security to the creditor) had been
clearly ascertained and properly vested in the hands of
trustees, then he would indicate the parcels of land to be
sold, and the time and conditions of sale; after this he could
if he chose admit the public creditor to subscribe his stock
into this new fund, or he might receive proposals for an
assignat from private individuals who would advance money
to purchase this sort of security.

This would be to proceed like men of business, methodi-
cally and rationally, and on the only principles of public and
private credit that there are. The dealer would then know
exactly what he purchased; and the only doubt that could
remain in his mind would be the dread of the resumption
of the spoil, which one day might be made (perhaps with
an addition of punishment) from the sacrilegious gripe of
those execrable wretches who could become purchasers at
the auction of their innocent fellow citizens.

An open and exact statement of the clear value of the
property and of the time, the circumstances, and the place
of sale were all necessary to efface as much as possible

127

Reﬂections on the Revolution in France

Edmund Burke

Part 3

the stigma that has hitherto been branded on every kind of
land-bank. It was also necessary, on account of the pledge
of faith they had given, that their future ﬁdelity in a slippery
concern might be established by their adherence to their
ﬁrst engagement. When they had ﬁnally determined on a
state resource from church plunder, they came on 14.iv.1790
to a solemn resolution on the subject, and promised their
country ‘that in the statement of the public charges for each
year, there should be brought to account a sum sufﬁcient
for defraying the expenses of the Roman Catholic religion,
the support of the ministers at the altars, the relief of the
poor, the pensions to the ecclesiastics of both sexes (secular
as well as regular), so that the estates and goods that are
at the disposal of the nation may be freed from all charges
and employed by the legislative body to the great and most
pressing needs of the state’. They further engaged, on the
same day, that the sum necessary for the year 1791 would
be forthwith determined.

In this resolution they admit it to be their duty to show
clearly the expense of the above objects which they had ear-
lier promised would be the ﬁrst to be provided for. They admit
that they ought to show the estate clear and disengaged from
all charges, and that they should show it immediately. Have
they done this immediately, or at any time? Have they ever
provided a rent-roll of the immovable estates, or given in
an inventory of the movable effects that they conﬁscate to
their assignats? How can they fulﬁll their engagements
of holding out to public service ‘an estate freed from all
charges’ without authenticating the value of the estate or the
amount of the charges? I leave it to their English admirers to
answer! Instantly on this assurance, before taking a single
step toward making it good, they issue. . . .£16,000,000. This
was manly [see Glossary]. Who, after this masterly stroke, can
doubt of their abilities in ﬁnance? ‘But then, before any

other emission of these ﬁnancial indulgences, they took care
at least to make good their original promise!’ —If such an
estimate has been made either of the value of the estate or
the amount of the encumbrances, it has escaped me.

At length they have spoken out, fully revealing their
abominable fraud in holding out the church lands as a
security for any debts or any service whatsoever. They rob
only to enable them to cheat, but in a very short time they
defeat the purposes of the robbery and the fraud by making
out accounts for other purposes that blow up their whole
apparatus of force and of deception. I am obliged to M. de
Calonne for his reference to the document that proves this
extraordinary fact; it had somehow escaped me.
Indeed
it was not necessary to make out my assertion as to the
breach of faith on the declaration of the 14.iv.1790. By a
report of their committee it now appears that the charge of
keeping up the reduced ecclesiastical establishments and
other expenses attendant on religion, and maintaining the
religious of both sexes, retained or pensioned, and the other
concomitant expenses of the same nature which they have
brought on themselves by •this convulsion in property, is
£2,000,000 sterling greater, annually, than the income of the
estates acquired by •it; not to mention a debt of £7,000,000
and upwards. These are the calculating powers of imposture!
This is the ﬁnance of philosophy! This is the result of all the
delusions held out to engage a miserable people in rebellion,
murder, and sacrilege, and to make them prompt and zealous
instruments in the ruin of their country!. . . .

[Now a paragraph setting out some of the other expenses

that the Assembly has not taken into account. Then:]

But it is unnecessary to dwell on these obvious kinds of
indebtedness. Have they made any clear statement of how
•the whole of the general and municipal establishments of all
sorts compares with •the regular income by revenue? Every

deﬁciency in the former becomes a charge on the conﬁscated
estate before the creditor can plant his cabbages on an acre
of church property. This conﬁscation is the only prop to keep
the whole state from tumbling to the ground. In this situation
they have purposely covered with a thick fog everything that
they ought to have industriously cleared; and then, blindfold
themselves, they drive by the point of the bayonets their
slaves, blindfolded indeed no worse than their lords, to take
their ﬁctions for currencies and to swallow down paper pills
at the rate of £34,000,000 sterling per dose. Then they
proudly lay claim to future credit on the basis of the failure
of all their past engagements, and at a time when it is clear
(if in such a matter anything can be clear) that the surplus
estates will never answer even the ﬁrst of their mortgages,
I mean that of the £16,000,000 sterling of assignats.
In
all this procedure I can discern neither the solid sense of
plain dealing nor the subtle dexterity of ingenious fraud. The
objections within the Assembly to opening the ﬂoodgates
to this inundation of fraud are unanswered, but they are
thoroughly refuted by a hundred thousand ﬁnanciers in the
street. These—·i.e. the numbers of people·—are the numbers
by which the metaphysical arithmeticians compute. These
are the grand calculations on which a philosophical public
credit is founded in France. They cannot raise •supplies, but
they can raise •mobs. . . .

Early this year the Assembly issued paper to the amount
of £16,000,000 sterling; what must have been the state
the Assembly has brought your affairs into when the relief
provided by such a vast supply has hardly been perceptible?
This paper also underwent an almost immediate depreci-
ation of 5%, which soon came to about 7%. The effect of
these assignats on the receipt of the revenue is remarkable.
M. Necker found that the collectors of the revenue who
received in coin paid the treasury in assignats. The collectors

made 7% by thus receiving in money and accounting in
depreciated paper.
It was easy to foresee that this was
inevitable, but still it was embarrassing. M. Necker was
obliged to buy gold and silver for the mint, which amounted
to about £12,000 above the value of the commodity gained.
(I believe that a considerable part of this happened in the
market of London.) That minister believed that the state
could not live on assignats alone, whatever their secret
nutritive virtue might be; that some real silver was necessary,
particularly for the satisfaction of those who, being equipped
with weapons, were not likely to be notably patient when
they saw that while an increase of pay was held out to
them in real money it was to be fraudulently drawn back by
depreciated paper. The minister, in this very natural distress,
asked the Assembly to order the collectors to pay in coins
what they had received in coins. It could not escape him
that if the treasury paid 3% for the use of a currency which
should be returned 7% worse than the minister issued it,
such a dealing could not do much to enrich the public! The
Assembly took no notice of his recommendation. They were
in this dilemma: if they continued to receive the assignats,
cash would become an alien to their treasury; if the treasury
refused those paper trinkets or discountenanced them to any
degree, they would destroy the credit of their sole resource.
They seem then to have made their option, and to have given
some sort of credit to their paper by taking it themselves;
at the same time in their speeches they made a swaggering
declaration. . . .that there is no difference in value between
metallic money and their assignats. This was a good, stout,
proof article of faith, pronounced under an anathema by the
venerable fathers of this philosophical synod. . . .

[Burke devotes about two more pages to details about the
ﬁnancial ruin of France, ending with some remarks about
the bad state of affairs in Paris. Then:]

The cost of maintaining Paris

This is the Paris on whose nourishment such immense
sums, drawn from the vitals of all France, have been spent
during the past year. As long as Paris stands in the place of
ancient Rome, so long she will be maintained by the subject
provinces.
It is an evil that inevitably accompanies the
dominion of sovereign democratic republics. As it happened
in Rome, it may survive the republican domination that gave
rise to it. In that case despotism itself must submit to the
vices of popularity.

Rome under her emperors combined the evils of both
systems, and this unnatural combination was one great
cause of her ruin.

It is a cruel and insolent imposition to tell the people that
the dilapidation of their public estate is bringing them relief.
Statesmen, before congratulating themselves on the ‘relief’
given to the people by the destruction of their revenue, ought
ﬁrst to have carefully thought about the answer to this:

Is it more advantageous to the people to (i) pay consid-
erably and gain in proportion, or to (ii) be freed from
all contributions and gain little or nothing?

My mind is made up to decide in favour of (i). Experience
is with me, and so are the best opinions, I believe. The
fundamental part of the skill of a true politician is ·the
ability· to keep a balance between •the subject’s power of
acquisition and •what the state demands from him. The
means of acquisition are prior in time and in arrangement.
Good order is the foundation of all good things. To be enabled
to acquire, the people must be tractable and obedient (not
servile). The magistrate must have his reverence, the laws
their authority. The body of the people must not ﬁnd the
principles of natural subordination artiﬁcially rooted out
of their minds. They must respect the property that they

cannot partake of. They must work to obtain what by work
can be obtained; and when they ﬁnd, as they commonly
do, that their success is not in proportion to the effort they
have put in, they must be taught their consolation in the
ﬁnal proportions of eternal [here = ‘divine’] justice. Whoever
deprives them of this consolation deadens their industry and
strikes at the root of all acquisition as of all conservation.
Someone who does this is the cruel oppressor, the merciless
enemy of the poor and wretched, at the same time that by
his wicked speculations he exposes the fruits of successful
industry and the accumulations of fortune to the plunder of
the negligent, the disappointed, and the unprosperous.

Too many professional ﬁnanciers are apt to see nothing in
revenue but banks, circulations, annuities on lives, tontines,
perpetual rents, and all the small wares of the shop. In a
settled order of the state these things are not to be slighted
and skill in them is to be respected. They are good, but only
when they are affected by that settled order and are built on
it. But when men think that these beggarly contrivances can
supply a resource for the evils that result from breaking up
the foundations of public order and causing or allowing the
principles of property to be subverted, they will leave in the
ruin of their country a melancholy and lasting monument
of the effect of preposterous politics and presumptuous,
short-sighted, narrow-minded ‘wisdom’.

The effects of the incompetence shown by the popular
leaders in all the great organs of the commonwealth are to
be covered with the ‘all-atoning name’ of liberty. In some
people I see great liberty indeed; in many, if not in most,
I see an oppressive and degrading servitude. But what
is liberty without wisdom and without virtue? It is the
greatest of all possible evils; for it is folly, vice, and madness,
untutored and unrestrained. Those who know what virtuous
liberty is cannot bear to see liberty disgraced by incompetent

130

heads on account of their having high-sounding words in
their mouths. . . . To make a government requires no great
prudence. Settle the seat of power, teach obedience, and
the work is done. To give freedom is even easier: there
is no need to guide; it only requires letting go the reins.
But to form a free government, i.e. to bring these opposite
elements of restraint and liberty together into one consistent
work, requires much thought, deep reﬂection, a sagacious,
powerful, and combining mind. I do not ﬁnd this in those
who take the lead in the National Assembly. Perhaps they
are not as miserably deﬁcient as they appear. I rather believe
it. If they were, it would put them below the common level
of human understanding. But when the leaders choose to
make themselves bidders at an auction of popularity, their
talents in state-construction will be of no service. They will
become ﬂatterers instead of legislators, instruments of the
people, not their guides. If any of them proposes a scheme of
liberty, soberly limited and deﬁned with proper qualiﬁcations,
he will immediately be outbid by his competitors who will
produce something more splendidly popular. Suspicions
will be raised about his ﬁdelity to his cause. Moderation
will be branded as the virtue of cowards, and compromise
as the prudence of traitors, until—hoping to preserve the
credit that may enable him to temper and moderate on some
occasions—the popular leader is obliged to become active in
propagating doctrines and establishing powers that will later
defeat any sober purpose he might eventually have aimed at.

Conclusion

But am I so unreasonable as to see nothing at all that
deserves commendation in the tireless labours of this Assem-
bly? I do not deny that some good things may have been done
among the countless acts of violence and folly. Those who

destroy everything are sure to remove some grievance. Those
who make everything new have a chance that they may estab-
lish something beneﬁcial. To give them credit for what they
have done with the authority they have usurped—to excuse
them for the crimes by which that authority was acquired—it
must appear that the same things could not have been
accomplished without producing such a revolution. Most
assuredly they could, because almost every one of their
regulations that is not very ambiguous was either •a part
of what the king voluntarily conceded at the meeting of the
states or •contained in the concurrent instructions to the
orders. Some usages have been abolished on just grounds,
but they were such that if they had stayed as they were for
ever they would have detracted little from the happiness and
prosperity of any state. The improvements of the National
Assembly are superﬁcial, their errors fundamental.

I would prefer my countrymen to recommend to our
·French· neighbours the example of the British constitution
rather than taking them as models for the improvement
of our own. In their constitution they have an invaluable
treasure. They are not, I think, without some causes
of anxiety and complaint, but these are due not to their
constitution but to their own conduct. I think our happy
situation is due to our constitution, but due to the whole
of it and not to any part singly, due in a great measure
to what we have left standing in our several reviews and
reformations as well as to what we have altered or added.
Our people will ﬁnd employment enough for a truly patriotic,
free, and independent spirit in guarding what they possess
from violation.
I would not exclude alteration, but even
when I changed ·the constitution· I would be doing this
so as to preserve ·it·.
I would be led to my remedy by a
great grievance. In this I would follow the example of our
ancestors: I would make the repairs as nearly as possible

in the style of the building. The ruling principles of our
forefathers in their most decided conduct included •politic
caution, •guarded circumspection, and •moral rather than
temperamental timidity. Not being illuminated by the light
of which the gentlemen of France tell us they have such an
abundant share, they acted under a strong impression of the
ignorance and fallibility of mankind. He who had made them
thus fallible rewarded them for attending to their nature
in their conduct. Let us imitate their caution if we wish to
deserve their fortune or to retain their bequests. Let us add,
if we please, but let us preserve what they have left; and,
standing on the ﬁrm ground of the British constitution, let
us be satisﬁed to wonder at the aeronauts of France [Burke’s
phrase] rather than trying to follow them in their desperate
ﬂights.

I have told you candidly my sentiments. I think they are
not likely to alter yours. I do not know that they ought. You
are young; you cannot guide but must follow the fortune of
your country. But hereafter they may be of some use to you,
in some future form which your commonwealth may take.
It can hardly remain in its present form; but before its ﬁnal
settlement it may be obliged to pass, as one of our poets
[Addison] says, ‘through great varieties of untried being’, and

in all its transmigrations to be puriﬁed by ﬁre and blood.

I have little to recommend my opinions but long observa-
tion and much impartiality. They come from one who has
been no tool of power, no ﬂatterer of greatness; and who in
his last acts does not wish to belie the tenor of his life. They
come from one almost the whole of whose public exertion has
been a struggle for the liberty of others; from one in whose
breast no lasting or vigorous anger has ever been kindled
except by what he considered as tyranny; and who snatches
from his share in the endeavours that are used by good men
to discredit opulent oppression the hours he has employed
on your affairs; and who in so doing persuades himself he
has not departed from his usual ofﬁce; they come from one
who has little desire for—and no expectation of—honours,
distinctions, and wealth; who has no contempt for fame,
and no fear of obloquy; who shuns quarrels though he will
risk voicing an opinion; from one who wishes to preserve
consistency, but who would preserve consistency by varying
his means to secure. . . .his end, and when the equipoise of
the vessel in which he sails is endangered by overloading it
on one side, is desirous of carrying the small weight of his
reasons to the other side so as to preserve its balance.
