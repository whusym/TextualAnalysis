Inquiry into the Human Mind

Thomas Reid

Chapter 1: Introduction

Chapter 1: Introduction

1. The subject’s importance, and how to study it

The structure of the human mind is intricate and wonderful,
like the structure of the human body. The faculties of the
mind are just as well suited to their various purposes as
are the organs of the body.
Indeed, because the mind is
nobler and of a higher order than the body, it is reasonable
to think that even more of God’s wisdom and skill went
into its structure ·than into that of the body·. So the
human mind is a subject well worth investigating—on its own
account but even more on account of how extensively the
knowledge of the mind affects every other branch of science.
[Throughout this work, ‘science’ means something like ‘knowledge that is
well established and theoretically organised’; and ‘arts’ covers the whole
range of activities—from agriculture and government to painting and
architecture—that involve practical skill, practical techniques and the
like.]

·This applies even to· the arts and sciences that have
least connection with the mind, ·because· even with them
we have to employ the faculties of the mind; and the better
we understand what they are and how they work, and what
defects and disorders they are prone to, the more skillfully
and successfully we shall apply them. But in the noblest arts
the mind is ·not only what we use but· also what we affect.
The painter, the poet, the actor, the orator, the moralist, and
the statesman all try to affect the mind in different ways and
for different purposes; and how well they succeed depends
on how skillfully they touch the strings of the human frame.
And their various •arts can’t ever stand on a solid foundation
or rise to the dignity of •sciences until they are built on the
principles of the human constitution.

1

Wise men now agree (or ought to!) that there is only one
route to knowledge of nature’s works; namely the path of
observation and experiment. We have built into us a strong
propensity for bringing particular facts and observations
under general rules, and applying such general rules to
•explain other effects or to •show us how to produce them.
This intellectual process is familiar to every human creature
in the common affairs of life, and it is the only one by which
any real discovery in philosophy can be made. [In this work,
‘philosophy’ is used in a broad sense in which it also covers science.
Many of Reid’s references to ‘the philosophers’ could as well be to ‘the
scientists’, but there is no clean line to be drawn between the two in
his text, so ‘philosophy’ and its cognates are left untouched, though an
occasional reminder will be supplied.]

The man who ﬁrst discovered that cold freezes water
and that heat turns it into vapour was using the same
general principles and the same method as Newton did in his
discovery of the law of gravitation and the properties of light.
His regulae philosophandi [= ‘rules for scientiﬁc and philosophical
thinking’] are maxims of common sense, and are practised
every day in common life; and anyone who philosophizes by
other rules, whether concerning the material system or the
mind, will get nowhere.

Conjectures and theories are created by men, and will
always be found to be very unlike the things created by God.
If we want to know the works of God, we must consult them
with attention and humility, not daring to add anything of
our own to what they declare. An accurate interpretation of
nature is the only sound and orthodox philosophy; anything
we add to that is spurious and carries no authority.

Inquiry into the Human Mind

Thomas Reid

Chapter 1: Introduction

All our ingenious theories about •the formation of the
earth, •the generation of animals, •the origin of natural and
moral evil, when they go further than what can be soundly
derived from facts, are empty folly, as much so as the
‘vortices’ of Descartes and the ‘Archæus’ of Paracelsus. The
philosophy of the •mind may have been as much adulterated
by theories as has the philosophy of the •material world. The
theory of ideas is indeed very ancient, and has been very
widely accepted; but neither age nor acceptance can •give
it authenticity, so they oughtn’t to •shelter it from being
examined freely and frankly—especially at the present time,
when the theory of ideas has produced a system of scepticism
that seems to triumph over all science and even over the
dictates of common sense.

All our knowledge of the ·human· body comes from
anatomical dissection and observation; so if we are to dis-
cover the powers and principles [= ‘driving forces’] of the mind
we must subject it to anatomical investigation.
[From now
on, when Reid uses ‘principle’ in that meaning—which was common in
his day—this version will substitute ‘force’ or a phrase including ‘energy’.
The equivalence may not be quite exact; on page 124, for instance, it
has Reid speaking of the ‘inductive force’ as casting light. But ‘force’ is
much nearer to his meaning than is ‘principle’ in our present sense of
that word.]

2. Obstacles to our knowledge of the human mind

It is much harder to anatomize the mind than to anatomize
the body; so it needn’t seem strange that mankind have
made less progress with the former. To attend accurately
to the operation of our minds—to think about them—is not
easy even for thoughtful people, and for most of mankind it
is next to impossible.

An anatomist may be fortunate enough to have opportu-
nities to examine—accurately, •with his own eyes—bodies
of different ages, sexes, and conditions, so that what is
defective, obscure, or abnormal in one may be clearly seen
in its most perfect state in another. But the anatomist of
the mind can’t have the same advantage. All that he can
examine with any degree of accuracy and clearness is his
own mind. This is the only subject he can •look into. He may
from outward signs infer what is going on in other minds; but
these signs are mostly ambiguous, and must be interpreted
in terms of what the anatomist perceives within himself.

No man has ever been able to set out for us, distinctly
and methodically, all the operations of the thinking principle
within him [here = ‘of whatever it is in him that drives his thought’];
but if some philosopher did achieve this feat, this would
reveal only the anatomy of •one particular subject; and
if applied to •human nature in general it would be both
incomplete and wrong. For you don’t have to think very hard
to realise that the differences amongst ·human· minds are
greater than the differences amongst any other beings that
we regard as belonging to the same species.

Some of our various powers and faculties seem to have
been planted and developed by nature, with nothing left for
human industry to do about them. Of this kind are the
powers that we have in common with the brutes [= ‘nonhuman
animals’]—the ones that are necessary for the preservation of
the individual or the continuance of the kind. Of some
other powers nature has only planted the seeds in our
minds, leaving their growth to human care. The proper
development of these powers is what makes us capable of all
those improvements in intellectual power, taste, and morals
that exalt and dignify human nature; while on the other
hand the neglect or perversion of them make us degenerate
and corrupt. The two-legged animal that

2

Inquiry into the Human Mind

Chapter 1: Introduction

eats of nature’s dainties what his taste or appetite asks

for,

satisﬁes his thirst at the crystal fountain,
propagates his kind whenever he has the opportunity

and the urge,

ﬁghts back against injuries, and
takes alternate labour and repose,

is, like a tree in the forest, purely of nature’s growth. But
this same savage has within him the seeds of the logician,
the man of taste and breeding, the orator, the statesman,
the man of virtue, and the saint. But these seeds, though
planted in his mind by nature, are not developed and used
and so must lie for ever buried and be hardly perceivable by
himself or by others.

Even the most minimal kind of social life will bring to
light some of those ‘seeds’ that lay hidden in the savage
state; and—according to the person’s training, the company
he keeps, and his way of life—some of them will •thrive
and grow up to great perfection, either through their native
vigour or through being deliberately developed; others will
•be perverted from their natural form; and yet others will •be
checked or perhaps quite eradicated.

This makes human nature so diversiﬁed in the individuals
who have it that it ﬁlls up all the moral and intellectual gap
that we conceive to be between brutes and devils below and
the celestial orders above. ·That is, some men are not much
stupider or morally worse than the lowest angels, and some
are not much brighter or morally better than the best of
the lower animals·. This enormous diversity of minds must
make it extremely difﬁcult to discover what is common to
the workings of all human minds.

The language in which philosophers discuss the original
faculties of the mind is so thoroughly designed to ﬁt the

3

currently accepted theory that it can’t ﬁt any other; like a
coat that ﬁts the man for whom it was made and makes
him look good though it sits very awkwardly on a differently
shaped man, even one as handsome and as well proportioned
·as the man for whom it was made·. It is hardly possible
to present any new discovery in our philosophy concerning
the mind and its operations without using new words and
phrases, or taking terms that are already in use and giv-
ing them different meanings; and taking that liberty with
language, even when it is necessary, creates prejudice and
misunderstanding, so that it takes time for it to be generally
accepted. For innovations in language, like innovations in
religion and government, are always suspected and disliked
by people in general until use has made them familiar and
long-time acceptance has made them legitimate.

[In this paragraph and throughout the rest of the work, Reid uses
‘reﬂection’ as Locke did, to mean ‘looking in on the events in one’s own
mind’.] If the original perceptions and notions of the mind
made their appearance •single and unmixed, as we ﬁrst
received them from the hand of nature, someone who was ac-
customed to reﬂection would have less difﬁculty in tracking
them; but before we are capable of reﬂection our perceptions
and notions are so •mixed, combined and recombined by
habits, associations and abstractions, that it is hard to know
what they were originally. The mind may in this respect be
compared to a pharmacist or a chemist: his materials are
indeed provided by nature; but for the purposes of his art
he mixes, compounds, dissolves, evaporates, and vaporises
them until they have a quite different appearance, making it
very hard to know what they were at ﬁrst, and even harder to
bring them back to their original and natural form. The mind
doesn’t do this work by deliberate acts of mature reason,
which we might recollect, but by means of instincts, habits,
associations, and other sources of mental energy that operate

Inquiry into the Human Mind

Chapter 1: Introduction

before we come to the use of reason; so that it is extremely
difﬁcult for the mind to retrace its own steps and track down
the operations that it has been busy with since it ﬁrst began
to think and to act.

If we could obtain a clear and full history of everything
that has happened in the mind of a child, from the begin-
ning of life and sensation until it grows up to the use of
reason—how its infant faculties began to work, and how they
brought out and ripened all the various notions, opinions,
and feelings that we ﬁnd in ourselves when we come to be
capable of reﬂection—this would be a treasure of natural
history, and would probably throw more light on the human
faculties than all the theories of philosophers since the
beginning of the world. But there’s no point in wishing
for something that nature hasn’t put within our reach. Our
only way of detecting the powers of the mind is reﬂection,
and that comes too late to be of any use in observing the
whole process through which nature brings the infant mind
to maturity.

A man who has grown up in all the prejudices of ed-
ucation, fashion, and philosophy will need great caution
and great concentration if he is to unravel his notions and
opinions until he ﬁnds out the simple and original forces
of his constitution, which can’t be explained ·in their turn·
except in terms of the will of ·God· our maker. This may be
truly called an analysis of the human faculties; and until it is
performed we have no chance of ﬁnding a sound theoretical
account of the mind—that is, a list of the original powers
and laws of our constitution, and an explanation in terms of
them of the various phenomena of human nature.

Success in an inquiry of this kind isn’t something we
can just choose to have; but perhaps it is possible for us
by caution and humility—·which we can choose·—to avoid
error and delusion. The labyrinth may be too intricate and

the thread too ﬁne to be traced through all its windings; but
if we stop where we can trace it no further, and secure the
ground we have gained, no harm is done; and at some later
time someone with a quicker eye may trace it further.

What adulterates philosophy and ﬁlls it with error and
false theory is high-level intellectual ability—not the lack
of it! A creative imagination despises the low-level tasks of
digging for a foundation, removing rubbish, and carrying
materials ·for the new structure that is to be built·. It leaves
these lowly tasks to the drudges in science, while it plans
a design and erects a structure. When more materials are
needed, it invents them, and imaginatively adds colouring
and every suitable ornament. The work pleases the eye;
it has everything except solidity and a good foundation!
It even seems to compete with the works of nature, until
some later architect blows it into rubbish and builds in its
place a structure of his own—one that is no worse than the
other.
It is a fortunate thing for us that the present-day
builders of castles ·in the air· are engaged more in writing
ﬁction than in doing philosophy. The writing of romances is
undoubtedly their province, and in those regions the children
of the imagination are legitimate, whereas in philosophy they
are all spurious.

3. The present state of this part of philosophy:
Descartes, Malebranche and Locke

Even those who have never closely examined it have grounds
for conjecturing that contemporary philosophy concerning
the mind and its faculties is in a very low state. Are any
principles regarding the mind settled with the clarity and
evidentness that the principles of mechanics, astronomy and
optics have? These really are sciences built on laws of nature
that hold good always and everywhere. When such a law is

4

Chapter 1: Introduction

discovered it is no longer a matter of dispute: future ages
may add to it, but once it has been established it can never
be overturned—until the course of nature changes! But
when we turn our attention in on ourselves and consider the
phenomena of human thoughts, opinions, and perceptions,
and try to bring them under the general laws and basic forces
in our constitution, we are immediately involved in darkness
and perplexity. And if our common sense or the results of
our upbringing happen not to be stubborn, we are likely to
end up in absolute scepticism.

In this part of philosophy Descartes found nothing estab-
lished that could serve as a deep foundation; so he resolved
not to believe in his own existence until he could give a
good reason for it. He may have been the ﬁrst person to
make such a decision; but if he could have actually done
what he resolved to do—if he could have become genuinely
unsure that he existed—his case would have been deplorable,
and there would have been no remedy for it from reason or
philosophy. A man who disbelieves his own existence is
surely as unﬁt to be reasoned with as a man who thinks he
is made of glass. There may be physical disorders that can
produce such absurdities, but they won’t ever be cured by
reasoning. Descartes wants us to think that he got out of
this craziness through this logical argument: Cogito, ergo
sum [= ‘I think, therefore I exist’]. But obviously he was in his
right mind all the time, and never seriously doubted his own
existence. That argument doesn’t •prove his existence—it
•takes it for granted. ‘I am thinking’, he says, ‘therefore I
am’; and isn’t it just as good reasoning to say, ‘I am sleeping,
therefore I am’? or ‘I am doing nothing, therefore I am’? If
a body moves it must exist, no doubt; but if it is at rest it
must exist then too.

Descartes’s argument is an enthymeme [= ‘an argument in
which one or more premises are left unstated’]. Perhaps what he

was relying on ·as an unstated premise· was not •his own
existence but rather •the existence of thought; and was
inferring from that the existence of a mind, something that
had the thought. But why didn’t he prove the existence of
his thought? You may say ‘Consciousness assures him of
that’. But who assures him that consciousness is truthful?
Can any man prove that his consciousness can’t deceive
him? No man can; and we can’t give a better reason for
trusting consciousness than that every man, while his mind
is sound, is caused by the constitution of his nature to
believe it unquestioningly, and to laugh at or pity anyone
who doubts its testimony. And isn’t every sane man as ﬁrmly
caused to take his existence on trust as his consciousness?
The other proposition assumed in this argument ·that I
am conjecturing Descartes had in mind·, namely that there
can’t be thought unless there is something that has it, is
open to the same objection: not that it isn’t evidently true,
but that it isn’t more clearly evident than the proposition
that is supposed to be proved by it. And taking all these
propositions together—

I think,
I am conscious,
everything that thinks exists,
I exist

—wouldn’t every serious person form the same opinion of a
man who seriously doubted any one of them? If he were your
friend, wouldn’t you hope for his cure from medicine and
good food and exercise rather than from metaphysics and
logic?

Furthermore, supposing it has been proved that my
thought and my consciousness must be had by •something,
and consequently that •I exist, how do I know that all the
series of thoughts that I remember belong to one subject,
and that the I of this moment is the very same individual I

of yesterday and of times past? Descartes didn’t see ﬁt to
start this doubt; but Locke did, and in order to resolve it
he solemnly laid it down that personal identity consists in
consciousness; that is, if you are conscious that you did x
a year ago, this consciousness makes you the very person
that did x. Now, consciousness of what is past can only
mean remembering it; so that Locke’s principle must be that
identity consists in remembering, and consequently a man
must lose his personal identity with regard to everything he
forgets.

These aren’t the only cases where our ·currently accepted·
philosophy concerning the mind seems to be very fruitful in
•creating doubts while doing a miserable job of •resolving
them.

Descartes, Malebranche and Locke have all used their
talents and skill to prove the existence of a material world;
and with very little success! Poor uneducated folk believe
unquestioningly that there is a sun, moon and stars; an
earth that we inhabit; country, friends and relations that
we enjoy; land, houses and furniture that we possess. But
philosophers, pitying the credulity of the vulgar, resolve not
to trust anything that isn’t founded on reason. [Throughout
this work, the ‘vulgar’ are just common folk with not much education;
they needn’t be guilty of ‘vulgarity’ in our sense.] These philosophers
ask philosophy to supply them with reasons for believing
things that all mankind have believed without being able
to give any reasons for doing so. One might expect that in
matters of such importance the proof would be easy; but
in fact it is the most difﬁcult thing in the world. For these
three great men, with the best good will, have not been able
to draw from all the treasures of philosophy one argument
that is ﬁt to convince a thinking man of the existence of
anything other than himself. Admired Philosophy! daughter
of light! parent of wisdom and knowledge! if that’s what you

are, then surely you haven’t yet risen and started to shine
on the human mind, or blessed us with more of your rays
than are sufﬁcient to •cast a ‘darkness visible’ on the human
faculties, and to •disturb the peace and security enjoyed by
happier people who never approached your altar or felt your
inﬂuence! But if indeed you aren’t able to dispel those clouds
and phantoms that you have revealed or created, withdraw
this skimpy and malignant ray: I despise philosophy and
renounce its guidance; let my soul dwell with common sense.
[Reid was quoting from Milton’s Paradise Lost, where hell has ‘no light,
but rather darkness visible’.]

4. In defence of those philosophers

But instead of despising the dawn of light, we ought rather
to hope for its increase; instead of blaming the philosophers
I have named for the defects and blemishes of their system,
we ought rather to honour their memories as the ﬁrst discov-
erers of a previously unknown region in philosophy. However
lame and imperfect their system may be, they have opened
the way to future discoveries and are entitled to a great share
of the credit for them. They have removed a vast amount
of dust and rubbish that had collected in the ages of bad
reasoning by the scholastics [= ‘the Roman Catholic Aristotelians’],
and had blocked the path forward. They have put us on
the right road, that of experience and accurate reﬂection.
They have taught us to avoid the traps of ambiguous and
ill-deﬁned words, and have spoken and thought abut this
subject with a sharpness and clarity formerly unknown.
They made many openings that may lead to the discovery of
truths that they didn’t reach, or to the detection of errors in
which they were entangled.

It may be observed that of all the defects and blemishes
in the accepted philosophy concerning the mind, the ones

6

that have most exposed it to the contempt and ridicule of
sensible men have chieﬂy come from this:

5. Bishop Berkeley.
Nature.Scepticism

·Hume’s· Treatise of Human

The adherents of this philosophy, led by a natural
prejudice in her favour, have tried to extend her
jurisdiction beyond its proper limits by setting her
up as a judge of the •dictates of common sense.

But these •dictates refuse to be judged in this way; they
despise the trial of reasoning, and disown its authority; they
don’t look to reason for help or fear its attacks.

In this unequal contest between common sense and phi-
losophy the latter will always come off with both dishonour
and loss; nor can she ever prosper until this rivalry is
dropped, philosophy gives up encroaching on the territory
of common sense, and a cordial friendship is restored; for
the fact is that common sense doesn’t need philosophy’s
•permission to say what it does, nor does it need philosophy’s
•help. On the other side (if I may be permitted to change the
metaphor), philosophy’s only root is the principles of common
sense; it grows out of them, and draws its nourishment from
them; when it is cut off from this root its honours wither, its
sap is dried up, it dies and rots.

The philosophers of the recent past whom I have men-
tioned did not attend to preserving this union and subor-
dination as carefully as the honour and the interests of
philosophy required; but philosophers of the present time
have openly waged war with common sense, and hope to
make a complete conquest of it through the subtleties of
philosophy—as audacious and futile as the attempt of the
giants to dethrone almighty Jove!

I don’t think that the present age has produced two more
acute or more skillful workers in this part of philosophy than
the Bishop of Cloyne and the author of the Treatise of Human
Nature. [These are Berkeley and Hume respectively. Hume’s Treatise
had been published anonymously, and Reid accordingly writes of ‘the
author of the Treatise of Human Nature’ without identifying him. This
was a courtesy; he knew quite well who the author was. In this version
Hume will be named often.] Berkeley was no friend to scepticism,
and had that warm concern for religious and moral principles
that was ﬁtting for his rank in the church; yet the result
of his inquiry was a serious belief that there is no such
thing as a material world—nothing in nature but spirits [=
‘minds’] and ideas—and that the belief in material substances
and in abstract ideas are the chief causes of all our errors
in philosophy, and of all disbelief and heresy in religion.
His arguments are based on the principles that had been
laid down by Descartes, Malebranche and Locke, and that
have been very generally accepted. And the opinion of the
ablest judges seems to be that his arguments haven’t been
and can’t be blocked—that he has proved by unanswerable
arguments things that no man in his senses can believe.

Hume proceeds on the same principles, but takes them
the whole way: as Berkeley undid the whole material world,
Hume on the same grounds undoes the world of spirits,
and leaves nothing in nature but ideas and impressions,
without any subject on which they may be impressed [=
‘without anything that can have them’].

It seems to be a peculiar streak of humour in this author
to start off with an introduction in which he promises—
keeping his face straight—nothing less than a complete
system of the •sciences, on an entirely new foundation,

7

Inquiry into the Human Mind

Thomas Reid

Chapter 1: Introduction

namely •human nature; when the intention of the whole
work is to show that there is no •human nature and no
•science in the world. It may perhaps be unreasonable to
complain of this conduct in an author who can’t mean to
disappoint his reader or laugh at his credulity, because
he doesn’t believe that he or his reader exists! Yet I can’t
imagine that the author of the Treatise of Human Nature
is so sceptical that he would defend himself in this way.
He believed, against his own principles, that he should be
read and that he should retain his personal identity until he
reaped the honour and reputation that his metaphysical skill
entitled him to. Indeed he openly admits that it was only
when he was alone in his study that he could accept his own
philosophy; being in the company of others had the effect
of daylight, dispelling the darkness and fogs of scepticism
and making him give in to the rule of common sense. And I
have never heard him being accused of doing anything, even
in solitude, that indicated such a degree of scepticism as
his principles maintain. Surely if his friends had feared that
he would, they would have the kindness never to leave him
alone!

Pyrrho of Elis, the father of this philosophy, seems to have
embraced it more thoroughly than any of his successors; for
it is reported. . . .that his life corresponded to his doctrine.
Thus, if a cart ran against him or a dog attacked him. . . .he
wouldn’t stir a foot to avoid the danger, giving no credit to
his senses. Luckily for him he had servants who weren’t
such great sceptics; they took care to keep him out of harm’s
way, so that he lived to be ninety years old. And it can’t
be doubted that Hume’s friends would have been equally
careful to keep him from harm, if ever his principles had
taken too strong a hold of him.

The Treatise of Human Nature was probably all written
in solitude; yet it contains clear indications that the author

every now and then relapsed into the faith of the vulgar, and
could hardly keep up the sceptical character for half a dozen
pages.

Similarly the great Pyrrho himself sometimes forgot his
principles. He is said once to have been in such a rage
with his cook—probably for not roasting his dinner to his
liking—that he chased the cook even into the market-place,
holding the spit with the meat on it.

It is a bold philosophy that unceremoniously rejects prin-
ciples which irresistibly govern the belief and the conduct of
all mankind in the common affairs of life—principles to which
the philosopher himself must surrender after he imagines he
has refuted them. Such principles are older than philosophy,
and have more authority than she does; she is based on
them, not they on her. If she could overturn them, she would
inevitably be buried in their ruins; but all the siege-machines
that philosophical subtlety can create are too weak for this
purpose; and the attempt is just as ridiculous as it would
be for a mechanic to construct a windlass for winching the
earth out of its circuit, or for a mathematician to claim he
could demonstrate that things equal to the same thing are
not equal to one another.

Zeno tried to demonstrate the impossibility of motion;
Hobbes, that there was no difference between right and
wrong; and Hume, that no credit is to be given to our senses,
to our memory, or even to demonstration. Such a philosophy
is truly ridiculous, even to those who can’t put a ﬁnger on
where it has gone wrong. All it could succeed in is showing
the acuteness of the sophist at the cost of disgracing reason
and human nature, and turning mankind into Yahoos [brutish
human-shaped creatures in Swift’s Gulliver’s Travels].

Chapter 1: Introduction

6. The Treatise of Human Nature

Even on a general view of this system of human nature ·of
Hume’s·, one forms some quick preliminary judgments that
make one suspicious of it.

Descartes, Hobbes and Hume have each of them given us
a ·supposedly complete· system of human nature, which is
an undertaking too vast for any one man, no matter how able
and creatively thoughtful he may be. Surely we have reason
to suspect that many parts of human nature never came
under their observation; and that others were stretched and
distorted so as to ﬁll up blanks and complete the system.
Christopher Columbus. . . .might almost as reasonably have
undertaken to give us a complete map of America.

Nature’s works have a certain character and style that is
never attained in the most perfect imitation of them. This
seems to be lacking in the systems of human nature I have
mentioned, especially in Hume’s. We see a puppet move and
gesture in various ways, and at ﬁrst we are impressed; but
when we look more closely and analyse it our admiration
ceases; we see exactly how the puppet-maker did it. How
unlike a real man it is! What a poor piece of work compared
with the •body of a man, about which this is true: the more
we know of its structure, the more wonderful we ﬁnd it to
be, and the more aware we are of our ignorance!
Is the
mechanism of the •mind so easy to understand when that
of the body is so difﬁcult? Yet according to Hume’s system,
the whole mechanism of sense, imagination, memory, belief,
and all the actions and passions of the mind are explained
by three laws of association together with a few original
feelings. Is this the man that nature made? I suspect it is
not so easy to look behind the scenes in nature’s work. This
·system of Hume’s· is a puppet, surely, constructed by an
over-bold apprentice of nature in mimicry of nature’s own

work. It looks good by candle light, but when it is brought
into daylight and taken to pieces it will appear to be a man
made with bricks and mortar! The more we know of other
parts of nature, the more we like and approve them. The
little that I know of

the planetary system,
the earth that we inhabit,
minerals, vegetables and animals,
my own body, and
the laws that govern all these parts of nature

opens to my mind grand and beautiful scenes, and con-
tributes equally to my happiness and power. But when
I look into myself and consider the mind that makes me
capable of all these views and pleasures, if it is indeed what
the Treatise of Human Nature says it is then it turns out
that I have merely been in an enchanted castle, deceived
by spectres and apparitions. I blush inwardly to think how
I have been deluded; I am ashamed of the kind of thing
I am, and can hardly refrain from protesting against my
destiny: Is this how you amuse yourself, O Nature, playing
such tricks on a silly creature and then to taking off your
mask and showing him how he has been fooled? If this is
the philosophy of human nature, I tell my soul: don’t enter
into her secrets! It is surely the forbidden tree of knowledge;
I no sooner taste of it than I see myself as naked, stripped
of everything—even of my very self.
I see myself and the
whole universe shrink into ﬂeeting ideas, dancing about in
emptiness like Epicurus’s atoms.

7. The system of all these authors is the same, and
it leads to scepticism

But what if these profound investigations into the basic
forces in human nature do naturally and necessarily plunge

9

Inquiry into the Human Mind

Thomas Reid

Chapter 1: Introduction

a man into this abyss of scepticism? And can’t we reason-
ably think that this is so, judging by what has happened?
Descartes no sooner began to dig in this mine than scepti-
cism was ready to break in on him. He did what he could to
shut it out.

Malebranche and Locke, who dug deeper, found it even
harder to keep out this enemy, but they honestly worked at
doing so. Then the work was carried on by Berkeley, who
despaired of saving everything but thought of a way out: give
up the material world (which he thought would be no loss,
and an advantage, he hoped), and set up an unbreakable
wall to secure the world of spirits. But, alas! the Treatise
of Human Nature recklessly undermined the foundation of
this wall, and drowned everything in one universal ﬂood ·of
scepticism·.

These facts, which are undeniable, do indeed give us
reason to suspect that •Descartes’s system of the human
understanding, which with some improvements made by
later writers is now generally accepted, had some defect
right at the outset; that •this scepticism is embedded in
the system ·because of that defect· and has grown up with
it; and, therefore, •that we’ll have to open it up right down
to its foundation and examine the materials ·of which it is
made· if we are to have any chance of raising any solid and
useful fabric of knowledge on this subject. (In what follows,
I shall call this system that derives from Descartes ‘the ideal
system’, ·because of its emphasis upon ‘ideas’·.)

8. We ought not to despair of ﬁnding a better
system

But is this to be despaired of because Descartes and his
followers have failed? By no means. To give up, feebly, would
be injurious to ourselves and to truth. ·And we shouldn’t

be daunted by the undeniable ability of those philosophers·.
Useful discoveries are sometimes found by superior minds,
but more frequently they come from the passage of time and
from accidental events. A traveller who has good judgment
may mistake his way, and be led unawares onto a wrong
route; and for as long as the ·wrong· road in front of him
is open and passable he may go on without suspicion, and
be followed by others; but when the road ends at a coal-pit,
he doesn’t need much judgment to know that he has gone
wrong, and perhaps to ﬁnd out what has led him astray.

This part of philosophy is in miserable state; and that has
had an effect that might discourage one from trying to ﬁnd
the right road. . . . Sensible men, who won’t ever be sceptics
about everyday matters, are apt to treat with lordly contempt
everything that has been or can be said on this subject. They
say:

It’s metaphysics—who listens to that? Let scholastic
fallacy-mongers entangle themselves in their own
cobwebs; I’m determined to take on trust my own
existence and that of other things, and to believe that
snow is cold and honey sweet, whatever they may say
to the contrary. Someone who tried to ·budge me from
this position by argument would be trying to· reason
me out of my reason and senses. He would have either
to be a fool or to be wanting to make a fool out of me.
I don’t know what answer a sceptic can make to this, or
by what good argument he can plead even for a hearing;
for either •his reasoning is fallacious, and so ought to be
ignored, or •there is no truth in the human faculties, and
then why should we reason? So if a man should ﬁnd himself
entangled in this metaphysical net and be unable to ﬁnd any
other way to escape, let him bravely •cut the knot that he
can’t •untie, and curse metaphysics. (And dissuade everyone
from having anything to do with it. For if I have been led into

10

Chapter 2: Smelling

bogs and quagmires by following a will-o’-the-wisp, oughtn’t
I to warn others to beware of it?) If philosophy contradicts
herself, makes fools of her devotees, and deprives them of
every object worth pursuing or enjoying, let her be sent back
to the infernal regions from which she must have started
out.

But

is it absolutely certain that

this fair lady—
·philosophy, I mean·—does belong to the scepticism party?
Isn’t it possible that she has been misrepresented? Haven’t

brilliant men in earlier times often passed off their own
dreams as philosophy’s pronouncements? Should we, then,
condemn her without any further hearing? This would be
unreasonable. I have found her in all other matters to be
an agreeable companion, a faithful counsellor, a friend to
common sense and to the happiness of mankind. In fairness,
this entitles her to have me stay in touch with her, and to
trust her until I ﬁnd infallible proofs that she is not to be
trusted.

Chapter 2: Smelling

1. The order in which I shall take things.
The medium of smelling and the organ of smell

It is so hard to unravel the operations of the human under-
standing, to sort them out into their elementary forces or
drives, that we can’t expect to succeed in this unless we start
with the •simplest and proceed by very cautious steps to the
more complex. So the ﬁve external senses can claim to be
considered ﬁrst in an analysis of the human faculties; and
amongst those ﬁve we should start not with the noblest or the
most useful but with the •simplest, the sense whose objects
are least likely to be mistaken for other things. On this view,
the clearest and easiest way of analysing our sensations is
to take them in this order: smelling, tasting, hearing, touch,
and, last of all, seeing. ·I shall give these a chapter each;
chapter 6, on seeing, will constitute more than half of the
book. The many facets of the human mind other than the
senses are touched upon in the book’s ﬁnal paragraph·.

Natural philosophy [= ‘natural science’] tells us that all an-
imal and vegetable bodies (and probably all or most other
bodies) while exposed to the air are continually giving off
efﬂuvia—emanations of enormously ﬁnely divided matter—
doing this not only when they are alive and growing but also
when they are fermenting and rotting. These volatile particles
probably repel each other, and so scatter themselves in the
air until they meet with other bodies to which they have
some chemical afﬁnity, and with which they unite and form
new combinations. All the smell of plants and of other bodies
is caused by these volatile parts, and is smelled wherever
they are scattered in the air; and the acuteness of smell in
some animals shows us that these efﬂuvia spread far, and
that the particles making them up must be inconceivably
small.

Some chemists think that each species of body has a
directing spirit, a kind of soul, which causes the smell and
all the properties of that species; the spirit is extremely

11

Inquiry into the Human Mind

Thomas Reid

Chapter 2: Smelling

volatile, they think, and ﬂies about in the air searching for a
proper place to land. [For Reid and his contemporaries, ‘soul’ often
meant simply ‘mind’, with no essential religious implications.] I shan’t
inquire into this. Like most other theories, this one perhaps
comes more from imagination than from sound induction.
But there is no reason to doubt that all bodies are smelled by
means of efﬂuvia that they give off and that are drawn into
the nostrils along with the air. So there is a clear appearance
of design in the fact that the organ of smell is placed inside
the canal through which the air is continually passing when
we breathe in and out.

Anatomy tells us that the wisdom of nature has assigned
the mucus membrane, and the olfactory nerves that are run
to the hairy parts of this membrane, to the sense of smell; so
that a body can’t be smelled when it doesn’t emit any efﬂuvia,
or it does but they don’t enter the nose, or they do enter but
the mucus membrane or olfactory nerves have become unﬁt
to do their work. Despite all this ·knowledge that we have·, it
is obvious that neither the •organ of smell, nor the •medium,
nor any •motions we can conceive to be caused in the mucus
membrane or in the nerve or animal spirits, have the faintest
resemblance to the sensation of smelling. That sensation
could never by itself have led us to think of nerves, animal
spirits, and efﬂuvia.
[The ‘medium’ to which Reid refers consists
in the efﬂuvia, the tiny particles of matter that the cheese (say) gives off,
connecting the cheese with the nose—mediating between them. ‘Animal
spirits’ were thought to be an extremely ﬁnely divided ﬂuid or gas that
acted as, so to speak, the body’s hydraulic system.]

2. The sensation ·of smell· considered abstractly

Having set out these facts about the medium and organ of
this sense, let us now attend carefully to what the mind is
conscious of when we smell a rose or a lily. Because our

language provides no other name for this sensation, I’ll call
it a ‘smell’ or ‘odour’, being careful to use those names only
for the sensation itself, at least until we have examined it.

Suppose that someone who has never had the sense of
smell suddenly comes to have it, and to smell a rose: can he
perceive any similarity or agreement between the smell and
the rose? or indeed between the smell and any other object
whatsoever? Certainly he cannot. He ﬁnds himself affected
in a new way, and he doesn’t know why or from what cause.
Like a man who feels some pain or pleasure for the ﬁrst time,
he is conscious that he isn’t the cause of it; but he can’t
from the nature of the thing work out whether it is caused
by body or spirit, by something near or something distant.
It isn’t like anything else, so there is nothing to compare it
with; and therefore he can’t infer anything about it except
perhaps that there must be some unknown cause of it.

It would obviously be ridiculous for him to think of
the smell as having •ﬁgure [= ‘shape’], •colour, •extension
or any other quality of bodies. He can’t give it a •place,
any more than he can give a place to sadness or joy; and
he can’t conceive it to have any existence except while it
is smelled. So it appears to be a simple and original [here
= ‘basic’] state or feeling of the mind, altogether inexplicable
and unaccountable. It can’t possibly be in any body: it is a
sensation; and a sensation can only be in a sentient thing.
The various odours have each their different degrees
of strength or weakness. Most of them are agreeable or
disagreeable; and frequently those that are agreeable when
weak are disagreeable when stronger. When we compare
different smells with one another we can perceive very few
resemblances or contrarieties (or indeed relations of any
kind) between them. They are all so simple in themselves and
so different from each other that it is hardly possible to divide
them into genera and species. [This is meant to contrast smells

12

Inquiry into the Human Mind

Thomas Reid

Chapter 2: Smelling

with (for example) shapes, which can be divided into genera and species:
taking closed plane ﬁgure as a genus, it has the species straight-sided
and curved-sided; the former of those divides further into three-sided
and four-sided and so on; the last of those divides into equal-sided and
unequal-sided, and so on. This goes with the fact that squareness (for
example) is obviously a complex or compound property, not a simple one:
for a thing to be square is for it to be plane and closed and four-sided
and equilateral. Reid’s point is that we seem to have no comparable way
of saying of any smell that for a thing to have this smell is for it to be F
and G and H; we can’t break a smell down into its simpler constituents;
each smell seems to be simple just in itself.] Most of the names we
give to smells are particular—the smell ‘of a rose’, ‘of jasmine’,
and the like. Yet they also have some general names—‘sweet’,
‘stinking’, ‘musty’, ‘putrid’, ‘cadaverous’, ‘aromatic’. Some
smells seem to refresh and animate the mind, others to
deaden and depress it.

3. Sensation and memory: natural producers of
belief

So far we have considered the sensation of smell abstractly.
Let us next compare it with other things to which it has
some relation. And ﬁrst I shall compare this sensation with
•remembering it and with •imagining it.

I can think of the smell of a rose when I don’t smell it;
and I could think of it at a time when there was no rose or
smell-of-a-rose anywhere in the universe. But when I smell
it, I am forced to believe that the sensation really exists. This
is common to all sensations: just as

they can’t exist without being perceived,

so also

they can’t be perceived unless they exist.

I could as easily doubt my own existence as the existence
of my sensations. Even those profound philosophers who

have tried to disprove their own existence have still left their
sensations to stand on their own feet with no that has them,
rather than question whether they really exist.

So a sensation such as a smell can be presented to the
mind in three different ways: it may be •smelled, it may
be •remembered, it may be •imagined or thought of. In the
•ﬁrst case, it must be accompanied by a belief that it exists
right now; in the •second, it is must be accompanied by a
belief that it did exist in the past; and in the •third it isn’t
accompanied by any belief, and is instead what the logicians
call a ‘simple apprehension’.

I don’t think that any philosopher can give a shadow of a
reason why sensation should compel our belief in the present
existence of the thing, memory a belief in its past existence,
and imagination no belief at all. All we can say is that
such is the nature of these operations. They are all •simple
and •original and therefore inexplicable acts of the mind.
·If they weren’t •simple, they might be ‘explained’ at least
in the sense of being analysed into their constituent parts;
and if they weren’t •original—meaning basic—they might be
explained by being traced back to the mental processes that
underlay them·.

Suppose that just once I smelled a tuberose in a certain
room where it grew in a pot and gave off a very pleasant
perfume. Next day I report what I saw and smelled. When
I attend as carefully as I can to what happens in my mind
when I do this, it seems evident that the very thing I saw
yesterday, and the fragrance I smelled then, are now the
immediate objects of my mind when I remember it. Further-
more, I can imagine this pot and ﬂower carried to the room
where I am now sitting and giving off the same perfume; and
here again it seems that the individual thing that I saw and
smelled is the ·immediate· object of my imagination. ·Here
is why I stress ‘immediate’·.

13

Inquiry into the Human Mind

Thomas Reid

Chapter 2: Smelling

Philosophers tell me that in a case like this

the immediate object of my memory and imagination
is not •the past sensation but •an idea of it, an image
or ‘phantasm’ or ‘ species’ of the odour I smelled: this
idea now exists in my mind, or in my sensorium;
and when the mind contemplates this pleasant idea
it ﬁnds it to be a representation of •what is past or of
•what may exist, and accordingly calls it ‘memory,’ or
‘imagination’.

[‘Phantasm’ and ‘species’ are technical terms in some philosophies; they
don’t play a signiﬁcant role in this work, though they are mentioned
again on page 130. The ‘sensorium’ was supposed to be the part of
brain where sensations are recorded and perhaps stored.] This is the
doctrine of the ideal philosophy; I shan’t go into it now,
because that would interrupt the thread of the present
investigation. Memory, when I attend to it as carefully as
I can, seems to me to have as its object things that are
past rather than present ideas of them. I shall examine this
system of ‘ideas’ later, and will try to convince you that •no
solid proof has ever been advanced of the existence of ideas;
that •they are a mere ﬁction and hypothesis invented to
explain the phenomena of the human understanding; that
•they don’t in fact explain anything; and that •this hypothesis
of ideas or images of things in the mind or in the sensorium is
the parent of those many paradoxes (so shocking to common
sense) and of the scepticism that disgrace our philosophy of
the mind and have brought on it the ridicule and contempt
of sensible men.

In the meantime, permit me to join the vulgar in think-
ing that when I remember the smell of the tuberose, the
immediate object of my memory is that very sensation that
I had yesterday and that now doesn’t exist; and that when
I imagine it as present, the object of my imagination is the
sensation itself and not any idea of it. But though the •object

of my sensation, memory and imagination is in this case the
same, these •acts or operations of the mind are as different
and as easy to tell apart as are smell, taste and sound.
I am conscious of a difference in kind between sensation
and memory, and between both and imagination.
I also
ﬁnd this: the sensation compels my belief in the present
existence of the smell, and memory compels my belief in its
past existence. The immediate testimony of sense is: There
is a smell. The immediate testimony of memory is: There
was a smell. ‘Why do you believe that the smell exists?’ The
only answer I will ever be able to give is: ‘Because I smell it.’
‘Why do believe that it existed yesterday?’ I can only answer:
‘Because I remember it.’

•Sensation and •memory therefore are simple, original,
and perfectly distinct operations of the mind, and both are
original generators of belief.
Imagination is distinct from
both, but doesn’t generate belief. Sensation implies the
present existence of its object; memory its past existence; but
imagination views its object nakedly, without any belief in
its existence or its non-existence, so imagination is what the
·Aristotle-inﬂuenced· universities call ‘simple apprehension’.

4. Sometimes judgment and belief precede simple
apprehension

But here again the ideal system shoulders its way forward,
and tells us that the mind’s ﬁrst engagement with its ideas
is simple apprehension—that is, the bare conception of a
thing without any belief concerning it—and that after we
have acquired simple apprehension we compare our ideas
and perceive agreements or disagreements between them;
and—·according to Locke·—that what we call ‘belief’, ‘judg-
ment’ or ‘knowledge’ is nothing but this perception of the
agreement or disagreement of ideas. This whole story seems

14

Inquiry into the Human Mind

Thomas Reid

Chapter 2: Smelling

to me to be ﬁction with no basis in nature, and here is why.
[Reid’s very compressed statement of the reason depends on
two equations:

(1) imagining x = (2) having a simple apprehension of x

[see page 13], and

(3) having a sensation of something = (4) being in a certain

state that involves belief.

The second equation conﬂicts with much of what Reid says
about sensation, but perhaps he thinks it follows from
his recent statement that ‘Sensation implies the present
existence of its object’. Anyway, with those equations in
hand, Reid argues

•You can’t have (1) unless you ﬁrst have (3) (everyone
agrees about this), so
•You can’t have (2) unless you ﬁrst have (4).

In his words:] (4) apprehension accompanied by belief and
knowledge must go before (2) simple apprehension, at least
in the matters we are now speaking of. So that in the
present context instead of saying that •we get belief or
knowledge by putting together and inter-relating simple
apprehensions, we ought to say that •simple apprehension
is done by resolving and analysing a natural and original
judgment. The operations of the mind in this context are like
natural bodies. Bodies are compounded of simple elements,
but nature doesn’t exhibit these elements separately leaving
it to us to make compounds of them; rather, she exhibits
them mixed and compounded in concrete bodies, and it is
only by art and chemical analysis that they can be separated.

5. Two theories of the nature of belief refuted.
Conclusions.

But what is this belief or knowledge that accompanies
sensation and memory? Every man knows what it is but no

15

man can deﬁne it. Does anyone claim to deﬁne sensation or
to deﬁne consciousness? It’s just as well that nobody does!
And if no philosopher had ever tried to deﬁne and explain
belief, some paradoxes in philosophy—more incredible than
ever emerged from the most abject superstition, or the most
frantic fanaticism—would never have seen the light. An
example of this, surely, is that modern revelation of the
ideal philosophy—·speciﬁcally, in Hume’s version of it·—that
•sensation, •memory, •belief and •imagination, when they
have the same object, are only different degrees of strength
and liveliness in the idea. Take the example of the idea
of a future state after death. One man believes it ﬁrmly;
this means merely that he has a strong and lively idea of it.
Another man neither believes nor disbelieves, i.e. he has a
weak and faint idea. Suppose now a third person believes
ﬁrmly that there is no life after death; I am at a loss to know
whether his idea is faint or lively: if it is faint, then there can
be a ﬁrm belief where the idea is faint; if the idea is lively,
then the belief in a future state and the belief that there is no
future state must be one and the same! The same arguments
that are used to ‘prove’ that •belief implies only a stronger
idea of the object than •simple apprehension could just as
well be used to ‘prove’ that •love implies only a stronger idea
of the object than •indifference. And then what shall we say
of hatred? On this hypothesis it must be a degree of love or
a degree of indifference—which should we choose? You may
say ‘In love there is something more than an idea, namely
an affection of the mind’; but then can’t it be said with equal
reason that in belief there is something more than an idea,
namely an assent or conviction of the mind?

But perhaps it may be thought that arguing against this
strange opinion is as ridiculous as maintaining it. If someone
maintained that

Inquiry into the Human Mind

Thomas Reid

Chapter 2: Smelling

a circle, a square and a triangle differ only in size and
not in shape,

I don’t think he would ﬁnd anyone willing either to believe
him or to argue against him; but it is at least as shocking to
common sense to maintain that

sensation, memory and imagination differ only in
degree and not in kind.

I know it is said that in a delirium or in dreaming men are
apt to mistake one for the other. But does it follow from
this that men who are not dreaming or in a delirium can’t
distinguish them? ‘But how does a man know that he isn’t
in a delirium?’ I can’t tell, any more than I can tell how a
man knows that he exists. But if any man seriously wonders
whether he is in a delirium, I think it highly probable that
he is, and that it’s time to look for a cure—which I’m sure he
won’t ﬁnd in the whole system of logic!

·In section 4· I mentioned Locke’s notion of belief or
knowledge: he holds that it consists in a perception of
the agreement or disagreement of ideas; and prides himself
on this as a very important discovery.
[Here and elsewhere,
‘comparing’ two ideas is attending to them both at once, setting them side
by side, so to speak, not necessarily likening them to one another. We
still use ‘compare’ in that sense in just one locution—‘Let us get together
and compare notes’.] We shall have occasion later to examine
in more detail this grand principle of Locke’s philosophy,
and to show that it is one of the main pillars of modern
scepticism, although he didn’t intend to make that use of
it. At present let us only consider •how it agrees with the
instances of belief we are now considering, and •whether
it throws any light on them. I believe that the sensation I
have exists, and that the sensation I remember doesn’t now
exist but did exist yesterday. Here, according to Locke’s
system, I compare the idea of a sensation with the ideas of

16

past and present existence: at one time I perceive that this
idea agrees with that of present existence, but disagrees with
that of past existence; but at another time it agrees with the
idea of past existence, and disagrees with that of present
existence. Truly these ideas seem to be very capricious in
their agreements and disagreements! Besides, I can’t for the
life of me conceive what is meant by either. I say a sensation
exists, and I think I understand clearly what I mean. But
you want to make the thing clearer, so you tell me that there
is an agreement between the idea of that sensation and the
idea of existence. To be candid about it, this conveys to me
no light, only darkness. The only sense I can make of it is
as a quaint long-winded way of saying that the sensation
exists. I conclude, then, that the belief that accompanies
sensation and memory is a simple act of the mind which
can’t be deﬁned. It is in this respect like seeing and hearing,
which can never be so deﬁned as to be understood by those
who can’t see or hear; and to those who can see and hear
no deﬁnition can make those operations clearer than they
are already. Similarly, every man who has any belief (and it
would be a strange man who had none!) knows perfectly well
what belief is, but can never deﬁne or explain it. I conclude
also that sensation, memory and imagination, even where
they have the same object, are operations of quite different
kinds, and are perfectly distinguishable by people who are
sound and sober. Someone who is in danger of confusing
them with one another is indeed to be pitied; but whatever
relief he may ﬁnd from another art ·such as medicine·, he can
get no help from logic or metaphysics. I conclude further that
our believing in the •present existence of our •sensations and
in the •past existence of what we •remember is as thoroughly
built into the human constitution as is our believing that
twice two make four. The evidence of the senses, the evidence
of memory, and the evidence of the necessary relations of

Inquiry into the Human Mind

Thomas Reid

Chapter 2: Smelling

things are all distinct and original kinds of evidence, equally
grounded in our constitution; none of them depends on,
or can be resolved into, any other. [In that sentence, ‘evidence’
means ‘evidentness’. Reid is saying that these different faculties make
things evident in different ways.] To reason against any of them is
absurd; indeed, to reason for them is absurd! They are basic
principles, and thus fall within the province not of reason
but of common sense.

6.
In defence of metaphysical absurdities. The
theory of ideas implies that a sensation can exist
without there being anything that has it. Conse-
quences of this strange opinion

Having considered how the sensation of smelling relates to
remembering and imagining it, I proceed to consider how it
relates to a mind. . . . It is certain that no-one can conceive
or believe smelling to exist by itself, without a mind or
something that has the power of smelling—something of
which the smelling is called a sensation, an operation or a
feeling. But if you ask for a proof that sensation can’t exist
without a mind or sentient being, I confess that I can’t give
one, and that to purport to •prove this seems to me almost
as absurd as to •deny it.

This might have been said without any apology before
the Treatise of Human Nature appeared in the world. For
until then no-one, as far as I know, ever thought of •calling
in question the principle ·that sensation can’t exist without
a mind·, or of •giving a reason for believing it. There were
disputes about whether thinking beings are like gas or like
ﬁre, whether material or immaterial; but that thinking is an
operation of some kind of being or other—·some thing that
thinks·—was always taken for granted as a principle that
couldn’t possibly be called into question.

However, Hume has treated it as a vulgar prejudice, and
maintained that the mind is only a series of ideas and
impressions without any thing that has them; and as he
is undoubtedly one of the most acute metaphysicians that
this or any age has produced, his opinion deserves respect,
however contrary it is to what mankind commonly believes.
So I make this plea here, once and for all: When I accuse
this or that •metaphysical notion with being ‘absurd’, or with
being ‘contrary to the common sense of mankind’, please
don’t take offence. I don’t mean to disparage the intellects of
those who invented •such opinions or those who maintain
them. Indeed, the opinions or notions in question often come
not from any defect of understanding, but rather from an
excess of reﬁnement: the reasoning that leads to them often
throws new light on the subject, showing real genius and
deep penetration in the author, and the ·insights of the·
premises do more than compensate for the ·absurdity of the·
conclusion.

I think that the constitution of our nature leads us to
believe certain principles that we are compelled to take for
granted in the common concerns of life, without being able
to give a reason for them.
If I am right about this, then
those are what we call ‘the principles of common sense’, and
we dismiss as obviously ‘absurd’ anything that obviously
conﬂicts with them.

Indeed, if it is true, and to be accepted as a principle of
philosophy, that sensation and thought can exist without a
thinking being, we must recognize this as the most wonderful
discovery that was ever made. The principle from which it
is deduced is the accepted doctrine of ideas, and it does
indeed seem to follow validly and smoothly from that.
(It
probably wouldn’t have had to wait so long to be ‘discovered’
if it hadn’t been so shocking, and so much in conﬂict with
the common beliefs of mankind, that an uncommon degree

17

Inquiry into the Human Mind

Thomas Reid

Chapter 2: Smelling

of philosophical courage was needed to introduce it to the
world.) It is a fundamental principle of the ideal system that
every object of thought must be either an impression
or an idea, an idea being a faint copy of some earlier
impression.

This principle is so commonly accepted that Hume, although
his whole system is built on it, never offers the least proof of
it. It is on this principle, as a ﬁxed point, that he erects his
metaphysical siege-engines to overturn heaven and earth,
body and spirit; and so far as I can see it is altogether
sufﬁcient for that purpose. For if all we can think about are
impressions and ideas then ‘heaven’ and ‘earth’, and ‘body’
and ‘spirit’, and anything else you care to add to the list,
must either •signify only impressions and ideas or else •be
words with no meaning. So it seems that this notion, however
strange, is closely connected with the accepted doctrine of
ideas, and that we must either accept the conclusion or
challenge the premises.

Ideas seem to have something in their nature that is
unfriendly to other existences! They were ﬁrst introduced
into philosophy in the humble role of images or represen-
tatives of things; and in this role they seemed not only to
be inoffensive but to serve admirably well for explaining
how the human mind works. But since men began to
reason clearly and distinctly about them, they have gradually
supplanted their constituents, and undermined the existence
of everything but themselves. [Reid’s word ‘constituents’ here is
a little joke—pretending that in the preceding sentence the word ‘repre-
sentatives’ was used in its political sense.] •First, they discarded
all the secondary qualities of bodies—they ‘showed’ that ﬁre
isn’t hot, or snow cold, or honey sweet; and in short that
heat and cold, sound, colour, taste and smell are nothing
but ideas or impressions. •Bishop Berkeley raised them a
step higher, and ‘discovered’—by valid reasoning from the

same principles—that extension, solidity, space, ﬁgure, and
body are ideas, and that there is nothing in nature but
ideas and spirits. •But the triumph of ideas was completed
by the Treatise of Human Nature, which discards spirits
also, leaving ideas and impressions as the only things in
the universe. What if at last, having nothing else to battle
against, they should come to blows with one another and
leave nothing at all existing in nature? That would surely
bring philosophy into danger, for what would it leave us to
talk or to dispute about? However, these philosophers have
so far acknowledged the existence of impressions and ideas;
they accept certain laws of attraction, or rules of precedence,
according to which ideas and impressions sort themselves
into various forms and succeed one another; but they have
found it to be a vulgar error to suppose that they belong to
a mind as its proper goods and chattels. [The force of ‘proper’
here is this: a given idea belongs to one particular mind, and could not
belong to any other.] These ideas are as free and independent
as the birds of the air, or as Epicurus’s atoms when they
journeyed through the vastness of space.

Shall we conceive them as being like the ‘ﬁlms’ of things
in the Epicurean system?. . . . Or do they rather resemble
Aristotle’s ‘intelligible species’ after they are shot out from
the object and before they have reached the passive intellect?
But why should we try to compare them with anything, since
they are the only things that exist? They •constitute the
entire content of the universe; they •come into existence and
go out of existence without any cause; they •combine into
packages that the vulgar call ‘minds’; and they •follow one
another according to ﬁxed laws, without being at any time
or in any place, and with no author of those laws.

Yet, after all, these self-existent and independent ideas
look pitifully naked and destitute when in this way they
are left alone in the universe; they seem on the whole to

18

Inquiry into the Human Mind

Thomas Reid

Chapter 2: Smelling

be in a worse condition than they were before. Descartes,
Malebranche and Locke made much use of ideas, and in
return treated them handsomely, providing them with decent
accommodation—in the pineal gland, or in the pure intellect,
or even in the divine mind. They moreover clothed them
with a commission [= ‘rescued them from their “nakedness” by giving
them a job’] and made them representatives of things, which
gave them some dignity and character. But the Treatise of
Human Nature, though no less indebted to ideas, seems to
have repaid them poorly by giving them this independent
existence. Because of that they are turned out of house
and home, and set adrift in the world without friend or
connection, without a rag to cover their nakedness; and
who knows whether the whole system of •ideas will perish
through the indiscreet zeal of their friends to exalt •them?

However this may be, it is certainly a most amazing
‘discovery’ that thought and ideas can exist without any
thinking being: a discovery full of consequences that can’t
easily be followed by those deluded folk who think and reason
in the ordinary way. We were always apt to imagine that
thought presupposes a thinker, and love a lover, and treason
a traitor: but it seems that this was all a mistake; and it has
been ‘discovered’ that there can be treason without a traitor,
love without a lover, laws without a legislator, punishment
without a sufferer, succession without time, and motion
without anything that moves or space for it to move in; or if
in these cases ideas are the lover, the sufferer, the traitor, I
wish the author of this ‘discovery’ had done us the favour of
telling us whether ideas can converse together and be under
obligations of duty or gratitude to each other; whether they
can make promises and enter into leagues and covenants,
and fulﬁl or break them, and be punished for the breach? If
one set of ideas makes a covenant, another breaks it, and
a third is punished for it, there is reason to think that this

system doesn’t have the virtue of justice built into it!

It seemed very natural to think that the Treatise of Hu-
man Nature required an author, and a very ingenious one at
that; but now we learn that it is only a set of ideas that came
together and arranged themselves by certain associations
and attractions.

After all, this curious system seems not to be appropriate
to the present state of human nature. How far it may suit
some •rare spirits who have been cleansed of the dregs of
common sense I can’t say.
I think it is agreed that even
•these can go along with this system only at times when they
are intensely theorizing, when they soar so high in pursuit
of those self-existent ideas that they lose sight of everything
else. But when they condescend to mingle again with the
human race, and to chat with a friend, a companion or a
fellow citizen, the ideal system vanishes; common sense like
an irresistible torrent sweeps them along; and, in spite of
all their reasoning and philosophy they believe in their own
existence and in the existence of other things.

Indeed, it’s just as well that they do so; for if they did
take their closet belief with them out into the world, the rest
of mankind would think them diseased and send them to a
hospital. Therefore, just as Plato required certain previous
qualiﬁcations for those who entered his school, I think it
would be prudent for the teachers of this ‘ideal’ philosophy
to do the same: they should refuse to admit anyone who is
so weak as to think that •he ought to have the same beliefs
in company as in solitude, or that •his principles ought to
have some inﬂuence on his conduct. For this philosophy is
like a child’s toy horse which a man who is in bad health
(·and so unable to ride a real horse·) may ride in his bedroom
without hurting his reputation; but if he rode it to church or
the stock-market or the theatre his heir would immediately
call a jury ·to declare the man insane· and seize his estate.

7. The conception of and belief in a sentient being
or mind is suggested by our constitution.
The notion of relations is not always acquired by
comparing the related ideas

Leaving this philosophy to those who have occasion for it,
and can use it discreetly as a private exercise, we can still
ask:

How have the rest of mankind—and even the ‘ideal’
philosophers themselves, except in some solitary
moments—come to have such a strong and irresistible
belief that thought must have a subject, must be the
act of some thinking thing? How does it happen that
every man believes himself to be something distinct
from his ideas and impressions; something that con-
tinues to be the same identical self when all his ideas
and impressions are changed?

It is impossible to trace the origin of this opinion in his-
tory, for all languages have it interwoven in their original
construction. All nations have always believed it. The
constitution of all laws and governments, as well as the
common transactions of life, presuppose it.

It is equally impossible for any man to recollect when
he himself came by this notion; for as far back as we can
remember we already had it, and were as fully convinced
of our own existence and the existence of other things as
we were that one and one make two. So it seems that
this opinion preceded all •reasoning and •experience and
•instruction; and this is the more probable because we
couldn’t get it by any of •these means.
It appears, then,
to be an undeniable fact that all mankind, constantly and
invariably from the ﬁrst dawning of reﬂection, infer from
•thought or sensation that there is a •power or faculty
of thinking and a permanent •thing or mind which has

that power; and that, just as invariably, we ascribe all the
various sensations and thoughts we are conscious of to one
individual mind or self.

But by what rules of logic we make these inferences it is
impossible to show. Indeed, it isn’t even possible to show
how our sensations and thoughts can so much as give us the
notion and conception of either a mind or a ·power or· faculty.
The •faculty of smelling is something very different from the
actual •sensation of smelling; for the faculty can remain
when we have no sensation. [The next sentence corrects what was
evidently a slip on Reid’s part; he writes of the mind’s being different from
‘the faculty’, but that is not what his line of thought requires.] And the
•mind is just as different from the •sensation; for it continues
to be the same individual thing when the sensation ceases.
Yet this sensation suggests to us both a faculty and a mind;
and as well as suggesting the notion of them it creates a
belief in their existence; although it is impossible to discover
by reason any tie or connection between one and the other.
What shall we say, then, about those inferences that
we draw from our sensations, namely the existence of a
mind and of powers or faculties belonging to it? Are they
(1) prejudices of philosophy or education, mere ﬁctions of
the mind, which a wise man should throw off as he does the
belief in fairies? or (2) judgments of nature, judgments that
don’t come from setting ideas side by side and perceiving
agreements and disagreements, but are immediately inspired
by our constitution?

If (2) is the case, as I think it is, it will be impossible to
shake off those opinions, and we must eventually give in to
them even if we struggle hard to get rid of them. And if we
could through determined obstinacy shake off the principles
of our nature, doing this would be the act not of a philosopher
but of a fool or madman. Those who think that these are
not natural principles have an obligation to show •how else

20

Inquiry into the Human Mind

Thomas Reid

Chapter 2: Smelling

we can have acquired the notion of a mind and its faculties,
and •how we come to deceive ourselves into the opinion that
sensation can’t exist without a sentient being.

It is the accepted doctrine of philosophers that our no-
tions of relations can only be had by comparing the related
ideas [see the explanation of ‘compare’ on page 16]; but our present
topic seems to provide be a counterexample to that. It is not
by ﬁrst having the notions of •mind and •sensation and then
comparing them together that we perceive that

mind involves the relation of a subject or substratum
of. . . , and
sensation involves the relation of an act or operation
of. . . .

On the contrary, one of the related things, namely sensation,
•suggests to us both the other thing and the relation between
them. Let me use the word •‘suggestion’, because I don’t
know of a more suitable one to express a power of the
mind that seems entirely to have escaped the notice of
philosophers—a power to which we owe many of our simple
notions that are neither impressions nor ideas, as well as
many original principles of belief.
I shall try to illustrate
what I mean by this word through an example. We all know
that a certain kind of sound suggests immediately to the
mind a coach passing in the street; and it makes us not only
•imagine a coach passing but also •believe that a coach is
passing. But this belief doesn’t come from any comparing of
ideas, or perception of agreements or disagreements. ·If it
did, it would have to be an •agreement·; but there isn’t the
slightest •likeness between the sound we hear and the coach
we imagine and believe to be passing.

It is true that this suggestion isn’t natural and original; it
is the result of experience and habit. But I think it appears
from what I have said that there are also natural suggestions,
·of which the following three are notable·:

•Sensation suggests the notion of present existence, and
the belief that what we perceive or feel does now exist;
•memory suggests the notion of past existence, and the
belief that what we remember did exist at a past time;
and

•our sensations and thoughts also suggest the notion of
a mind, and the belief that it exists and relates in a
certain way to our thoughts.

A similar natural thought brings it about that

•something’s coming into existence or altering in some
way suggests to us the notion of a cause, and forces
us to believe in its existence.

Similarly, as I’ll show when we come to the sense of touch,
our nature is so constituted that certain sensations of touch
suggest to us extension, solidity and motion, which are in no
way like sensations though they have been hitherto confused
with them.

8. There is a quality or virtue in bodies which
we call their smell. How this is connected in the
imagination with the sensation

[Here and later, Reid uses ‘virtue’ in a sense in which it means about
the same as ‘power’. He presumably sees some difference, because three
times he writes of ‘power or virtue’.] We have considered smell as
signifying a sensation, feeling or impression on the mind,
and in this sense it can only be in a mind or sentient being;
but obviously mankind give the name ‘smell’ much more
often to something that they think of as external, as being
a quality of a body. They understand by ‘smell’ something
that doesn’t at all imply a mind, and they have no difﬁculty
in conceiving the air perfumed with aromatic odours in the
deserts of Arabia or on some island where human feet never
trod. . . .

21

Inquiry into the Human Mind

Thomas Reid

Chapter 2: Smelling

Suppose that an ordinary person meets with a modern
philosopher and asks: ‘What is the smell in plants?’ The
philosopher answers: ‘There isn’t any smell in plants, or in
anything but the mind. There couldn’t possibly be smell
anywhere except in a mind; and all this has been demon-
strated by modern philosophy.’ The plain man will probably
think he is joking; but if he ﬁnds that he is serious, his
next conclusion will be that the philosopher is mad; or that
philosophy, like magic, puts men into a new world and gives
them different faculties from common men.
In this way
philosophy is set at variance with common sense. But who
is to blame for it?

In my opinion the philosopher is to blame. For if he
means by ‘smell’ what the rest of mankind usually mean,
he is certainly mad. But if he gives the word a different
meaning without abiding by it himself or warning others,
he is misusing language and disgracing philosophy, without
doing any service to truth; like someone who switches the
meaning of the words ‘daughter’ and ‘cow’, and tries to prove
to his plain neighbour that his cow is his daughter, and his
daughter his cow. I believe there is not much more wisdom
·than that· in many of the paradoxes of the ideal philosophy
that strike plain sensible men as obvious absurdities, but
are counted by the devotees as profound discoveries. For
my part, I am determined always to pay a great regard to
the dictates of common sense, and not to depart from them
unless I absolutely have to; so I’m inclined to think that in
the rose or lily there really is something that the vulgar call
‘smell’ and that continues to exist when it isn’t smelled; and
I shall proceed to inquire what this is, how we come by the
notion of it, and what relation this •quality of smell has to
the •sensation that we also call ‘smell’ for lack of another
name for it.

So let us return to our supposition of a person who has
just begun to exercise the sense of smell. A little experience
will reveal to him that the nose is the organ of this sense,
and that the medium of it is the air or something in the
air. And ﬁnding by further experience that when a rose is
nearby he has a certain sensation, and when it is moved
away the sensation goes, he ﬁnds a connection in nature
between the rose and this sensation. He considers the rose
as a cause, occasion or antecedent of the sensation; and
considers the sensation as an effect or consequent of the
presence of the rose. They are associated in the mind, and
constantly found conjoined in the imagination. [In the phrase
‘cause [or] occasion or antecedent’ Reid goes from the strong ‘x caused y’
to the weaker ‘x occurred before y’ through the intermediate ‘x was the
occasion of y’. This use of ‘occasion’ expresses this idea: it wasn’t x but
God that caused y, but God was prompted to do this by the occurrence
of x, which provided him with an occasion for producing y. This makes x
less than a cause but more than a mere antecedent.]
But we should pay attention to this fact:

The sensation may seem more closely related to •the
mind (that has it) or to •the nose (its organ) than to
•the rose (which accompanies it); but it’s the third
of those connections—the connection with the rose—
that operates most powerfully on the imagination.

This seems to be because the sensation’s connection with
the mind is more •general, and doesn’t distinguish it from
other smells, or even from tastes, sounds and other kinds
of sensations.
Its relation to the organ, the nose, is also
•general, and doesn’t distinguish it from other smells. But
its connection with the rose is •special, and also constant, so
that the sensation and the rose become almost inseparable
in the imagination as do thunder and lightning, freezing and
cold.

9. There is a force at work in human nature from
which the notion of a body’s smell is derived, along
with all other natural virtues or causes

In order to illustrate further how we acquire the concept of
a quality or virtue in the rose that we call ‘smell’, and what
this smell is, we should bear in mind that the ·human· mind
begins very early to thirst after principles that can direct it in
the use of its powers. The smell of a rose is a certain state or
feeling of the mind; it isn’t constant, but comes and goes, so
we want to know when and where to expect it, and are uneasy
until we ﬁnd something whose presence brings this feeling
along with it and whose absence removes it. When we ﬁnd
this we call it the ‘cause of’ the smell, not meaning ‘cause’ in a
strict and philosophical sense implying that feeling was really
effected or produced by that cause, but in a popular sense
meaning only that there is a constant conjunction between
them. Such ‘causes’ are in reality nothing but laws of nature,
but the mind is satisﬁed with them. Having found the smell
thus constantly conjoined with the rose, the mind is at peace,
without considering whether this conjunction is due to a real
effectiveness or not—that being a philosophical question that
doesn’t matter in ·everyday· human life. But every discovery
of such a constant conjunction is really important in life,
and makes a strong impression on the mind.

We earnestly want to connect everything that we observe
to happen with something else as its cause or occasion; so
much so that we are apt on very slender evidence to think
that we have found connections. This weakness is most
clearly to be seen in ignorant people who know least of the
real connections established in nature. A man meets with an
unlucky accident on a certain day of the year, and knowing
no other cause of his misfortune he is apt to think there
is something unlucky about that day of the calendar; and

if he has bad luck on a second occurrence of that date he
will be strongly conﬁrmed in his superstition.
[Reid then
gives an example.] However silly and ridiculous this opinion
was, it grew from the root in human nature from which
all natural philosophy grows—namely, an eager desire to
discover connections in things, and a natural, basic and
inexplicable tendency to believe that the connections that we
have observed in times past will continue in the future. (1)
Omens, portents, good and bad luck, palmistry, astrology, all
the numerous arts of divination and of interpreting dreams,
false hypotheses and systems are all built on the same
foundation in the human constitution as (2 ) true principles
in the philosophy of nature . All that distinguishes them is
that in (1) we conclude rashly from too few instances whereas
in (2) we conclude cautiously from a sufﬁcient induction.

As it is only experience that reveals to us these connec-
tions between natural causes and their effects, we without
further inquiry credit the ‘cause’ with having some vaguely
and unclearly conceived power or virtue to produce the effect.
In many cases the concerns of ·everyday· life don’t make
it necessary to give different names to the cause and the
effect; and so it comes about that one name is used for both,
because although they are very unlike one another they are
closely connected in the imagination. (In ordinary talk the
common name is most frequently applied to the one of the
two that happens to be the main object of our attention.) This
leads to an ambiguity in many words, a kind of ambiguity
that turns up in all languages, because the causes of it are
present in all. This kind of ambiguity is apt to be overlooked
even by philosophers. Some instances will serve both to
illustrate and conﬁrm what I have been saying about it.
‘Magnetism’ signiﬁes both •the tendency of the iron toward
the magnet, and •the power of the magnet to produce that
tendency. If we were asked ‘What is magnetism—a quality of

23

Inquiry into the Human Mind

Thomas Reid

Chapter 2: Smelling

the iron or a quality of the magnet?’ we would perhaps be
puzzled at ﬁrst; but a little attention would reveal to us that
we conceive a •power or virtue in the magnet as the cause,
and a •motion in the iron as the effect; and although these
things are quite unlike, they are so united in the imagination
that we give the common name ‘magnetism’ to both. The
same thing may be said of ‘gravitation’, which sometimes
signiﬁes the tendency of bodies toward the earth, sometimes
the attractive power of the earth that we conceive as the
cause of that tendency. We may observe the same ambiguity
in some of Sir Isaac Newton’s deﬁnitions—even in words that
he himself coined. In three of his deﬁnitions he explains very
clearly what he understands to be

the absolute quantity of a centripetal force,
the accelerative quantity of a centripetal force, and
the motive quantity of a centripetal force.

The ﬁrst of these three deﬁnitions makes ‘centripetal force’
name the •cause, which we think of as some power or virtue
in the central body; in the second and third deﬁnitions the
same phrase is used to name the •effect of this cause, in
producing velocity or in producing motion toward the centre.
‘Heat’ signiﬁes a sensation, and ‘cold’ a contrary one. But
‘heat’ also signiﬁes a quality or state of bodies that has no
contrary but does have different degrees. When a man feels
the same water hot to one hand and cold to the other, this
gives him occasion to distinguish the feeling from the heat
of the body; and although he knows that the •sensations
are contrary, he doesn’t imagine that the •body can have
contrary qualities at the same time. And when he ﬁnds
that the same body tastes different when he is sick from
how it tastes when he is well, he is easily convinced that
the quality in the •body called ‘taste’ is the same as before
although the •sensations he has from it—·which are also
called ‘taste’·—are perhaps opposite.

The vulgar are commonly accused by philosophers of
absurdly imagining the smell in the rose to be somehow like
the sensation of smelling: but the accusation is unfair, I
think, because the vulgar don’t give the same name to both
·the objective smell and the sensation·, nor do they reason in
the same manner from them. •What is smell in the rose? It is
a quality or virtue of the rose, or of something given off by the
rose, which we perceive through the sense of smelling; and
this is all we know of the matter. •What is smelling? It is an
act of the mind, but is never imagined to be a quality of the
mind. Again, the sensation of smelling is conceived to imply
necessarily a mind or sentient being; but smell in the rose
implies no such thing. We say ‘This body smells sweet’, ‘That
body stinks’; but we don’t say ‘This mind smells sweet’ or
‘That mind stinks’. So •smell in the rose and •the sensation
that it causes are not thought of, even by the vulgar, as
things of the same kind, although they have the same name.
From what I have said we can learn that ‘the smell of a

rose’ signiﬁes two things:

(1) A sensation, which can’t exist except when it is
perceived, and can exist only in a sentient being or
mind.
(2) Some power, quality or virtue in the rose, or in
efﬂuvia that it gives off, which has a permanent
existence independently of the mind and which by
the constitution of nature produces the sensation in
us.

We are fundamentally so built that we are •led to believe
that there is a permanent cause of the sensation, and are
•prompted to look for it; and experience leads us to locate
it in the rose. The names of all smells, tastes and sounds,
as well as heat and cold, are similarly ambiguous in all
languages; but we should note that in common languages
these names aren’t often used to signify (1) the sensations;

24

Inquiry into the Human Mind

Thomas Reid

Chapter 2: Smelling

for the most part they signify (2) the external qualities that
are indicated by the sensations. Here is what I think to be
the cause of this phenomenon.

Our sensations vary greatly in strength. Some are so
quick and lively that they give us a great deal of pleasure
or of discomfort. When this is the case, we are compelled
to attend to the sensation itself—to think and talk about
it—so we give it a name that stands for the sensation and
nothing else; and in this case we accept that what the name
stands for is only in the mind and not in anything external.
Examples include the various kinds of pain, sickness, and
the sensations of hunger and other appetites. But where the
sensation doesn’t matter to us in such a way that we need
to think about it, our constitution leads us to consider it
as a sign of something external that is constantly conjoined
with it; and when we have found the item of which it is
a sign we give a name to that; and the sensation, having
no name to itself, falls into place as an accessory to the
thing it signiﬁes, and is confusingly given the same name.
So the name may indeed be applied to the sensation, but
most properly and commonly is applied to the thing that the
sensation indicates. The sensations of smell, taste, sound
and colour are of inﬁnitely less importance •in themselves
than they are •as signs or indications; like the words of a
language, where our attention is focussed not on •the sound
but on •the sense.

10. In sensation is the mind active or passive?

One question remains to be investigated: In smelling and
in other sensations, is the mind active or passive? This
may strike you as a merely verbal question, or at least as
a very unimportant one; but if it leads us to attend to the
operations of our minds more accurately than we usually do,

that alone makes it worth looking into. Modern philosophers,
I think, hold that in sensation the mind is entirely passive.
This is undoubtedly true to this extent: •we can’t have any
sensation in our minds just by willing it ·in the way you can
raise your arm just by willing it·; and on the other hand •it
seems hardly possible to avoid having the sensation when
the object is presented. Yet it seems likewise to be true
that a sensation is more or less thoroughly perceived and
remembered depending on how much attention is given to it.
Everyone knows that very intense pain can be diverted by
a surprise, or by anything that entirely occupies the mind.
When we are engaged in earnest conversation, the clock may
strike nearby without being heard; at least, a moment later
we don’t remember having heard it. The noise and tumult of
a great trading city isn’t heard by those who have lived in it
all their life, but it stuns visitors to the city who have lived
in the peaceful retirement of the country. Can there be any
sensation where the mind is purely passive? I shan’t answer
this, but I don’t think we ever remember any sensation—even
a very recent one—without being conscious of having given
it some attention when it occurred.

No doubt when the impulse is strong and unusual it’s
hard to withhold attention from it—as hard as it is to keep
from crying out in racking pain, or jumping when suddenly
frightened. In each of these ·reactions· it might be possible
through strong resolution and practice to do better, but it
isn’t easy to ﬁnd out how far one can go with this. The
ancient Aristotelians had no good reason to suppose that
we have an active intellect and a passive intellect, because
attention can quite well be accounted an act ·not of the
intellect but· of the will; and yet I think they came nearer
to the truth in holding that in sensation the mind is partly
passive and partly active than the moderns do in afﬁrming
it to be purely passive. The vulgar have always thought of

25

Inquiry into the Human Mind

Thomas Reid

Chapter 3: Tasting

sensation, imagination, memory and judgment as acts of the
mind. The way they are referred to in all languages shows
this. When the mind is very busy in them we say it is very
active; whereas if they were merely impressions [= ‘effects’] (as
the ideal philosophy would have us think) we ought rather
to say that the mind is very passive; for I suppose no-one
would attribute great activity to the paper I write on just
because it receives a variety of words.

How the sensation of smell relates to remembering and
imagining it, and to a mind or subject ·that has the sensa-

tion·, is the same as for all our sensations, and indeed for
all the operations of the mind; how it relates to the will is
the same as for all the powers of understanding: and how
it relates to the quality or virtue of bodies that it indicates
is the same as for the sensations of taste, hearing, colour,
heat and cold; so that what I have said about this sense
may easily be applied to our various other senses and to
other operations of the mind; and this, I hope, excuses my
spending so long on it.

Chapter 3: Tasting

Much of what I have said about the sense of smelling is so
easily applied to those of tasting and hearing that I shall
leave it to the reader to re-apply it to those senses, and save
myself the trouble of a tedious repetition.

Probably everything that affects the sense of taste is to
some degree soluble in saliva.
It is not conceivable how
anything should enter easily—as though it wanted to—into
the pores of the tongue, palate and upper throat unless it had
some chemical afﬁnity to the ﬂuid with which these pores are
always ﬁlled. So it is an admirable device of nature’s to keep
the organs of taste always moist with a ﬂuid that is such
a universal solvent. This ﬂuid deserves more study than it
has so far received, both as a solvent and as a medical salve.
Nature teaches dogs and other animals to use it as a salve,
and its use in taste and digestion shows its effectiveness as
a solvent.

The organ of taste—·the tongue·—guards the entrance
to the alimentary canal, just as the organ of smell guards
the entrance to the canal for breathing. These arrangements
are obviously suitable, and obviously designed. From the
fact that these organs are so placed that everything that
enters the stomach must ﬁrst be checked by both senses
it is plain that they were intended by nature to distinguish
good food from bad. The brutes haven’t any other means
of choosing their food, and nor would mankind if it were
in the savage state. Our senses of smell and taste have
probably been impaired, and made less ﬁt to do their natural
work, by the unnatural kind of life men commonly lead
If they weren’t at all impaired by luxury or
in society.
bad habits, they would probably seldom if ever lead us to
a wrong choice of food among natural products, though
the artiﬁcial compositions of reﬁned and luxurious cookery,
or of chemistry and drug-preparation, may often deceive

26

Inquiry into the Human Mind

Chapter 3: Tasting

both senses by producing things that taste and smell good
although they are bad for our health.

These ·two· senses are also very useful for distinguishing
bodies that can’t be told apart by our other senses, and
to detecting the changes that a body undergoes and that
are often detected by taste and smell sooner than by any
other means. There are ever so many things in the market,
the eating-house and the tavern, as well as in shops where
drugs and medicines are sold, that are known to be what
they are claimed to be, and are perceived to be good or bad of
their kind, only by taste or smell. It’s not easy to determine
how much our judgment of things through our senses might
be improved by accurate attention to small differences in
·How things taste and smell are among
taste and smell.
their so-called ‘secondary qualities’, but we shouldn’t infer
from this that they are unimportant·. In a noble effort of
his great genius, Sir Isaac Newton tried to work out from
•the colour (·secondary quality·) of opaque bodies •what the
size (·primary quality·) is of the minute non-opaque parts of
which they are made up; and who knows what new lights
natural philosophy may yet receive from other secondary
qualities when they are properly examined?

Some tastes and smells stimulate the nerves and raise
the spirits; but such an artiﬁcial •raising of the spirits
is followed—in accordance with the laws of nature—by a
•lowering of them; and this can be relieved only by the
passage of time or by taking more of the same stimulant. By
using such things we create an appetite for them that is very
like a natural appetite and has all the latter’s force. This
is how men acquire an appetite for snuff, tobacco, strong
liquors, opium and the like.

It seems, indeed, that nature has carefully set limits to
the pleasures and pains we have through smell and taste,
conﬁning them within very narrow limits so that we shan’t

27

let any part of our happiness depend on them. For there
is hardly any smell or taste so nasty that we don’t ﬁnd
it tolerable, and eventually perhaps even agreeable, after
we have become used to it; and none so agreeable that it
doesn’t lose its attractiveness through constant use. Nor
is there any pleasure or pain of these ·two· senses that
isn’t introduced or followed by some degree of its contrary,
which nearly balances it. So that we may here apply the
beautiful allegory of the divine Socrates: although pleasure
and pain are contrary in nature, and their faces look in
different directions, yet Jupiter has tied them together so
that whoever takes hold of one of them pulls the other along
with it.

Of •smells that appear to be simple and uncompounded
there’s a great variety—they aren’t just unalike but some
of them are contrary to others. And the same can be said
of •tastes—it seems that one taste is just as different from
another taste as it is from a smell. So how do all smells come
to be considered as one genus, and all tastes as another?
What marks off each genus? Is it only (1) that the nose is
the organ of one, and the palate of the other? or is it rather
that (2) there is in the sensations themselves—never mind
the organs—something common to all smells, and something
else common to all tastes, and this is what distinguishes one
from the other? It seems most probable that (2) is right, and
that these sensations have a certain complexity although on
the surface they appear to be utterly simple.

Considering the matter abstractly, it would seem that a
number of sensations—or indeed a number of individuals of
any kind—which are perfectly simple and uncompounded
can’t be sorted into genera and species [= ‘classes and sub-
classes’], because if some •individuals belong to a •species it
must be the case that

Inquiry into the Human Mind

Thomas Reid

Chapter 4: Hearing

each has something that only it has, to mark it off
from the others,

and

they all have something in common, making them one
species.

The same may be said of •species that belong to one •genus.
Does this imply that there is something composite about
each species? I leave that to metaphysicians to answer. The
sensations of smell and of taste do undoubtedly vary in an
enormous number of ways that no language can express.
You could try ﬁve hundred different wines and hardly ﬁnd

two with precisely the same taste, and the same thing holds
for cheese and many other things. Yet of •ﬁve hundred
different tastes in cheese or wine, we can hardly ﬁnd •twenty
that we could describe so as to give a clear notion of them to
someone who hadn’t tasted them.

In 1675 Dr. Nehemiah Grew, a most judicious and
hard-working naturalist,. . . .tried to show that there are at
least sixteen different simple tastes, which he enumerated.
It’s easy to see how many compound ones could be made out
of all the various combinations of two, three, four, or more of
these simple ones. . . . And it is beyond doubt that if smells
were examined with the same accuracy they would turn out
to have as much variety as tastes.

Chapter 4: Hearing

1. The variety of sounds. Their place and distance
is learned by custom, without reasoning

Sounds probably vary as much as tastes and odours do.
For one thing, sounds differ in pitch. The ear is capable of
perceiving four or ﬁve hundred variations of pitch in sound,
and probably as many different degrees of strength; by
combining these we get more than twenty thousand simple
sounds that differ either in pitch or strength, supposing
every pitch to be perfect. But note this:

To make a perfect pitch a great many waves in elastic
air are required, all with the same wave-length and the
same duration; they have to follow one another with
perfect regularity; and each wave must be made of the

up and down movements of innumerable particles of
elastic air, whose motions all have the same direction,
force, and speed.

So we can easily conceive of an enormous variety in the
same pitch, arising from irregularities brought into it by
•the constitution, shape, situation or manner of striking the
sounding body, by •the constitution of the elastic medium,
·the air·, or its being disturbed by other motions, or by •the
constitution of the ear on which the effect is had. A ﬂute, a
violin, an oboe and a French horn may all sound a note of
the same pitch and yet be easily distinguishable. Indeed, if
twenty human voices sound the same note with the same
strength there will still be some difference. An individual
person’s voice can, while continuing to be recognisably that

28

Inquiry into the Human Mind

Thomas Reid

Chapter 4: Hearing

voice and no other, be varied many ways by sickness or
health, youth or age, leanness or fatness, good or bad mood.
We can tell whether words—the very same words—are being
spoken by a foreigner or by a native—indeed by whether they
are spoken by someone from this province rather than that.
Such an immense variety of sensations of smell, taste,
and sound was surely given to us for some purpose. They
are •signs by which we know external things and tell them
apart, and it was appropriate that the variety of the signs
should correspond to some extent with the variety of things
•signiﬁed by them.

It seems to be by custom that we learn to use the sounds
things make to tell us where they are located and what kinds
of things they are. It is probably by experience that we learn
to tell that this noise is in the street, that is in the room above
me; that this is a knock at my door, that is someone walking
upstairs. I remember an occasion when I was lying in bed,
having been frightened by something; I heard my own heart
beating, but I thought it was someone knocking at the door
and I got up and opened the door. This happened more than
once, until I eventually discovered that the sound was in my
own chest. It is probable that if we didn’t have ·relevant·
experience we wouldn’t know whether a sound came from the
right or left, from above or below, from nearby or far away,
any more than we could know without experience whether
it was the sound of a drum, or a bell, or a cart. Nature
is not wasteful in her operations; she won’t put herself to
the expense of a particular instinct to give us knowledge
that experience will soon produce through a general drive in
human nature.

For human nature is so constituted that a little experience
ties together in our imagination and also in our belief things
that were in their nature unconnected. When I hear a
certain sound, I conclude immediately—without thinking

about it—that a coach is passing by. There are no premises
from which this conclusion is inferred by any rules of logic.
It is the effect of a natural drive that we have in common
with the brutes.

Although it is hearing that enables us to perceive har-
mony and melody and all charms of music, it seems that
these ·also· require a higher faculty, which we call ‘a musical
ear’. Two people whose hearing is perfect may, it seems,
have this ‘musical ear’ in very different degrees; so it ought
not to be classed with •the external senses but regarded as
being •·a faculty· of a higher order.

2. Natural language

One of the noblest purposes of sound undoubtedly is lan-
guage, without which mankind would hardly be able to rise
higher than the brutes. The usual view is this:

Language is purely an invention of men, who by na-
ture are as speechless as the brutes. What they have
done, using their superior degree of invention and
reason, is to contrive artiﬁcial signs of their thoughts
and purposes and to establish them—·that is, their
meanings·—by common consent.

But the origin of language deserves to be looked into more
carefully. Doing this •may be of importance for the improve-
ment of language, and •it bears on my present subject, and
will tend to reveal some of the basic drives in human nature.
So I shall offer some thoughts on this subject.

By language I understand all the signs that mankind
use in order to communicate to others their thoughts and
intentions, their purposes and desires. Such signs can be
divided into two kinds, artiﬁcial and natural. An artiﬁcial
sign has no meaning except what is attached to it by contract
or agreement among those who use it; a natural sign is one

29

Inquiry into the Human Mind

Thomas Reid

Chapter 4: Hearing

which (independently of any contract or agreement) has a
meaning that every man understands through the drives in
his nature. Language can be called ‘artiﬁcial’ to the extent
that it consists of artiﬁcial signs, and ‘natural’ to the extent
that it consists of natural signs.

On the basis of these deﬁnitions I think it can be proved
that if mankind had no natural language they could never
have invented an artiﬁcial one through their reason and
ingenuity. For all artiﬁcial language supposes some contract
or agreement to attach a certain meaning to certain signs;
so there must be contracts or agreements before the use of
artiﬁcial signs; but there can’t be any contract or agreement
when there are no signs and no language; therefore there
must be a natural language before any artiﬁcial language
can be invented—Q.e.d.

If language were entirely a human invention, like writing
and printing, we would ﬁnd whole nations as speechless as
the brutes. Indeed the brutes do have some natural signs
by which they express their own thoughts, affections and
desires, and understand those of others. A newly hatched
chick understands the different sounds whereby its mother
calls it to food or warns it of danger. A dog or a horse
understands by nature when the human voice is kind and
when it is threatening. But as far as we know brutes have
no notion of contracts or covenants, or of a moral obligation
to keep them. If nature had given them these notions, she
would probably have given them natural signs to express
them. And where •nature has withheld these notions they
can’t be acquired by •art—·that is, through an exercise of
skill·—any more than a blind man can in that way acquire
the notion of colours. Some brutes have a sense of honour
or disgrace; they have resentment and gratitude; but as far
as we know none of them can make a promise or swear
to be faithful, because no such notions are built into their

constitution. If it weren’t the case that mankind have these
notions by nature and have natural signs to express them
by, not all their sharpness and ingenuity would have enabled
them to invent language.

The elements of this natural language of mankind, i.e.
the signs that naturally express our thoughts, may I think
be brought down to these three kinds: •modulations of the
voice, •gestures, and •facial expressions. By means of these,
two savages who have no artiﬁcial language in common can
converse together, can communicate their thoughts well
enough, can ask and refuse, afﬁrm and deny, threaten
and beg; can trade, enter into agreements, and swear to
be faithful. This could be conﬁrmed by unquestionable
historical facts if there any need to do so.

So mankind have in common a natural language, though
a scanty one that is ﬁtted only for the necessities of nature.
Given this language, no great ingenuity was required to
improve it by adding artiﬁcial signs to do things that the
natural signs don’t. As the arts of life are further developed
and as knowledge increases, these artiﬁcial signs inevitably
multiply. The articulations of the voice seem to be the
signs that work best for artiﬁcial language ; and because
all mankind have always used them for that purpose, we
can reasonably conclude that that’s what nature intended
them for. But nature probably doesn’t intend that we should
stop using the natural signs; it is enough that we make
up for their shortcomings by adding artiﬁcial ones. A man
who always rides in a chariot gradually loses the use of
his legs; and someone who used only artiﬁcial signs would
lose both the knowledge and use of natural ones. Dumb
people retain much more of the natural language than
others, because they have to use it; and for the same reason
savages have much more of it than civilized nations do. It is
mainly through natural signs that we give force and energy

30

Inquiry into the Human Mind

Thomas Reid

Chapter 4: Hearing

to language; and the less language has of them the less
expressive and persuasive it is. Thus,

•writing is less expressive when read silently than when
read aloud;
•reading aloud is less expressive than speaking without
a written text;
•speaking without the proper and natural modulations,
force, and variations of the voice is frigid and dead
compared with what you have when those things are
used;
•speech is still more expressive when we add the
language of the eyes and facial features; and
•speech is even better when to all the above we add the
force of physical gestures.

It is in this last case, and only there, that speech is in its
perfect and natural state, and produced with its proper
energy.

When speech is natural, it will involve using not only the
voice and lungs but also all the muscles of the body; like
the speech of dumb people and of savages, whose language
has more of nature in it ·than ordinary speech·, and is
accordingly more expressive and more easily learned. Isn’t
it a pity that the reﬁnements of a civilized life, instead of
making good for the defects of •natural language, should
root •it out and replace it by dull and lifeless sequences of
unmeaning sounds or the scrawling of meaningless letters?
It is commonly thought that the perfection of language

consists in expressing human thoughts and feelings clearly
by means of these dull signs; but if this is •artiﬁcial language
made perfect, it is surely •natural language turned rotten.

Artiﬁcial signs signify, but they don’t express; they speak
to the understanding, as the letters in algebra may also
do; but the passions, the affections and the will don’t hear
them. They stay quiet and inactive until we speak to them in
the language of nature, and then they are all attention and
obedience!

It would be easy to show that the ﬁne arts of the musician,
the painter, the actor and the orator are •natural to the
extent that they are •expressive. The knowledge of those
arts requires in us a delicate taste, precise judgment and
much study and practice; but the arts themselves are merely
the language of nature, which we brought into the world
with us but have unlearned through disuse, and so ﬁnd the
greatest difﬁculty in getting it back.

Abolish the use of articulate sounds and writing among
mankind for a century, and every man would be a painter,
an actor and an orator. I don’t mean that this is practicable;
or that if it were done the advantage would outweigh the loss.
But I do say that as men are led by nature and necessity to
converse together, they will use every means in their power
to make themselves understood; and when they can’t do this
by artiﬁcial signs they will do it as far as possible by natural
ones; and that the best judge in all the expressive arts must
be he who best understands the use of natural signs.

Chapter 5: Touch

Chapter 5: Touch

1. Heat and cold

The senses we have been considering are ·alike in two
fundamental ways. (1) They are all· very simple and uniform:
each of them presents only one kind of sensation, thereby
indicating only one quality of bodies. We perceive sounds
and nothing else by the ear, tastes by the palate, odours by
the nose. (2) The qualities that they indicate are also all of
one basic kind, being all •secondary qualities. In contrast
with this, what we perceive by touch is (1) not just one quality
but many, and (2) they are of very different kinds ·because
some are primary qualities and others secondary·. The main
ones are •heat and cold, •hardness and softness, •roughness
and smoothness, •shape, •solidity, •motion, and •extension.
I shall consider these in order.

As to heat and cold, it will easily be accepted that they
are secondary qualities, of the same basic kind as smell,
taste and sound; and therefore that what I have said about
smell is easily applicable to them. Namely, that each of the
words ‘heat’ and ‘cold’ has two meanings: they sometimes
signify •certain sensations of the mind, which can’t exist
except when they are felt and can’t exist anywhere but in
a mind or sentient being; but more frequently they signify
•a quality of bodies which, by the laws of nature, leads to
the sensations of heat and cold in us. This quality, though
connected by custom so closely with the sensation that we
can’t easily think of them as distinct from one another, isn’t
in the slightest like the sensation, and can continue to exist
when there is no sensation at all.

The •sensations of heat and cold are perfectly known, for
they aren’t and couldn’t be other than what we feel them

to be; but the •qualities in bodies that we ·also· call ‘heat’
and ‘cold’ are unknown. Our only conception of them is as
unknown causes or occasions of the sensations to which we
give the same names. But though common sense tells us
nothing about the nature of these qualities, it plainly dictates
that they do exist; and to say that there can be heat and
cold only when they are felt is such a gross absurdity that
it isn’t worth arguing against. What could be more absurd
than to say that the thermometer can’t rise or fall unless
some person is present, or that the coast of Guinea would
be as cold as Nova Zembla if no-one lived there?

It is the business of philosophers to investigate, through
proper experiments and induction, what heat and cold are
in bodies. Is heat •a particular kind of stuff that is spread
through nature and present in a concentrated form in a
hot body, or is it rather •a certain vibration of the parts of
the hot body? Are •heat and cold contrary qualities, as the
sensations of heat and cold undoubtedly are contrary, or is
it rather that •only heat is a quality, and cold is merely the
absence of it? These questions fall within the province of
philosophy [still = ‘science’], for common sense says nothing on
either side of either of them.

But whatever be the nature of the •quality of bodies that
we call ‘heat’, we certainly know this much about it: it can’t
in the least resemble the •sensation of heat. To suppose
that the sensation of heat resembles the quality of heat is
as absurd as to suppose that the pain of gout resembles
a square or a triangle. Nobody who has common sense
imagines that the ﬁre has in it the sensation of heat or
something that resembles that sensation. What the plain
man thinks is merely that there is in the ﬁre something that

32

Thomas Reid

Chapter 5: Touch

makes him and other sentient beings feel heat. But because
the word ‘heat’ in common language signiﬁes this unknown
something in the ﬁre more frequently and more properly
than it does the sensation occasioned by it, he rightly laughs
at philosophers who deny that there is any heat in the ﬁre
and thinks that they speak contrary to common sense.

2. Hardness and softness

Let us next consider hardness and softness—by which words
I always understand real properties or qualities of bodies
of which we have a distinct conception. When the parts
of a body adhere so ﬁrmly that it can’t easily be made to
change its shape, we call it ‘hard’; when its parts are easily
moved we call it ‘soft’. This is the notion that all mankind
have of hardness and softness: they aren’t sensations, and
they aren’t like sensations; they were real qualities before
they were perceived by touch, and continue to be so when
they are not perceived; for if anyone claimed that diamonds
weren’t hard until they were handled, who would ·think it
worthwhile to· reason with him?

There is no doubt a sensation by which we perceive a
body to be hard or soft.
It is easy to get this sensation
of hardness by pressing one’s hand against the table, and
attending to the feeling that results, setting aside as far
as possible all thought of the table and its qualities, or of
any ·other· external thing. But it is one thing to •have the
sensation, and another to •attend to it and make it a distinct
object of reﬂection. The •former is very easy, whereas the
•latter is usually extremely difﬁcult.

We are so accustomed to using the sensation as a sign,
and passing immediately to the hardness signiﬁed, that it
seems never to have been made an object of thought, either
by the vulgar or by philosophers; and it has no name in any

language. No sensation is more distinct, or more frequent;
yet we never attend to it, letting it pass through the mind
instantaneously, serving only to introduce the quality of
bodies which, by a law of our constitution, it suggests to
us. Sometimes it is easy enough to attend to the sensation
occasioned by the hardness of a body—for instance when it
is so violent as to occasion considerable pain. In that case
nature calls our attention to it, and we then acknowledge
that it is a mere sensation that can’t exist except in a sentient
being. If a man violently bangs his head against a pillar, I
ask him: Does the pain you feel resemble the hardness of
the stone? Can you conceive of an inanimate piece of matter
containing anything like what you feel?

The attention of his mind is here entirely turned toward
the painful feeling. He feels nothing in the stone, but—to
speak in the common language of mankind—he feels a violent
pain ‘in his head’. It is quite different when he leans his head
gently against the pillar; for then he will tell you that he feels
nothing in his head but feels hardness ‘in the stone’. Doesn’t
he have a sensation in this case too? Undoubtedly he has;
but it is a sensation that nature intended only as a sign of
something in the stone; and accordingly our man instantly
ﬁxes his attention on the thing signiﬁed, and would ﬁnd
it extremely difﬁcult to attend to his sensation enough to
be convinced that there is any such thing distinct from the
hardness it signiﬁes. But however hard it may be to attend
to this elusive sensation, to stop it from whipping past and
pull it apart from the external quality of hardness in whose
shadow it is apt immediately to hide itself, this is what a
philosopher ·or scientist· must become able to do, through
effort and practice. Otherwise he won’t be able to think
soundly about this subject, or even to understand what I am
saying here. For in subjects like this the ﬁnal appeal must
be to what a man feels and perceives in his own mind.

33

Inquiry into the Human Mind

Chapter 5: Touch

This is indeed a strange thing:

A sensation that we have every time we feel a body to
be hard, and which consequently we can have as often
and for as long as we wish, a sensation as distinct and
deﬁnite as any other, is so unknown •that it has never
been made an object of thought and reﬂection, and
never honoured with a name in any language; and
•that philosophers as well as the vulgar have entirely
overlooked it, or muddled it with the quality of bodies
that we call ‘hardness’—a quality to which it doesn’t
have the faintest likeness.

Can’t we infer from this that our knowledge of the human
faculties is still in its infancy? That we haven’t yet learned to
attend to the mental operations of which we are conscious
every hour of our lives? That very early in our lives we
acquire habits of inattention that are as hard to overcome
as other habits? ·As regards this last point·, I think it is
probable that this is the case:

The novelty of this sensation will get children to pay it
some attention at ﬁrst; but because the sensation is
in no way interesting in itself, as soon as it becomes
familiar it is overlooked, and the child’s attention is
turned solely to what the sensation signiﬁes, ·namely
the hardness of some external thing·. Analogously,
when someone is learning a language he attends to
the sounds; but when he is ﬂuent in the language he
attends only to the sense of what he wants to express.
If this is the case, we must become as little children again if
we want to be philosophers. We must overcome this habit of
inattention that has been gathering strength ever since we
began to think—a habit that is useful enough in common
life to make up for the difﬁculty it creates for the philosopher
who is trying to discover the fundamental forces at work in
the human mind.

The ﬁrm holding together of the parts of a body is no
more like that sensation by which I perceive the body to be
hard than the vibration of a booming body is like the sound
I hear; and I can’t possibly perceive through my reason any
connection between them. No man can give a reason why
the vibration of a body might not have given the sensation of
smelling, and the efﬂuvia of bodies affected our hearing, if
it had so pleased ·God·, our maker. Similarly, no man can
give a reason why hardness should not have been indicated
not by the sensation that does indicate it (because that is
how we are built) but rather by sensations of smell or taste
Indeed no man can conceive any sensation to
or sound.
resemble any known quality of bodies. Nor can any man
show by any good argument that all our sensations couldn’t
have been just as they are with no body or quality of body
having ever existed.

So here is a phenomenon of human nature that presents
itself for explanation. Hardness in bodies is something that
we conceive as distinctly, and believe as ﬁrmly, as anything
in nature. Our only route to this conception and belief is
through a certain sensation of touch, ·and there is a problem
about how that relates to hardness·. The sensation hasn’t
the faintest similarity to hardness, nor can we by any rules of
reasoning infer the quality from the sensation. The question
is: How do we come by this conception and belief?

First, the conception: shall we call it an idea of sen-
sation, or an idea of reﬂection? It won’t be classiﬁed as
‘of reﬂection’—·that is obvious·. But if we count it as ‘of
sensation’, we are calling something an idea ‘of sensation’
when it has no resemblance to any sensation! Thus, the
origin of this idea of hardness—one of our commonest and
clearest ideas—can’t be found anywhere in our systems of
the mind, not even in the ones that have tried so hard to
derive all our notions from sensations and reﬂection.

34

Inquiry into the Human Mind

Thomas Reid

Chapter 5: Touch

Secondly, taking it as given that we do have the conception
of hardness, how do we come to have our belief in it? Do we
ﬁnd some relation between the idea of that kind of sensation
and the idea of hardness-in-an-external-body—a relation
making it self-evident to us that such a sensation couldn’t
be felt unless such a quality of bodies existed? No. Can it
be established by •probable or certain arguments? No, it
can’t. Then have we acquired this belief through •tradition,
upbringing, or experience? No, it isn’t achieved in any of
these ways. Shall we then get rid of this belief, as having
no reasonable basis? Alas! the belief isn’t in our power;
it triumphs over reason, and laughs at all the arguments
of a philosopher. Even ·Hume·, the author of the Treatise
of Human Nature, though he saw no reason for this belief
and many against it, could hardly suppress it when he was
all alone and thinking theoretically; and at other times he
openly gave way to it, and admits to ﬁnding that he had to
do so.

What shall we say of this •conception and this •belief,
which are so hard to explain and hard to do anything with?
The only way out I can see is to conclude that some basic
force or source of energy in our make-up brings it about that
a certain sensation of touch both •suggests to the mind the
conception of hardness and •creates the belief in it; or, in
other words, to conclude that this sensation is a natural sign
of hardness. I shall now try to explain this more fully.

3. Natural signs

With •artiﬁcial signs there is often neither similarity between
the sign and the thing signiﬁed, nor any necessary connec-
tion between them arising from the nature of the things; and
the same holds true for •natural signs. The word ‘gold’ has
no resemblance to the substance signiﬁed by it; nor is it

intrinsically better ﬁtted to signify this substance than to
signify any other; and yet through habit and custom this
word suggests that substance and no other. Similarly, a
sensation of touch suggests hardness, although it doesn’t
resemble hardness and, so far as we can see, doesn’t have
any necessary connection with it. The difference between
these two signs—·i.e. between how ‘gold’ signiﬁes and how
the sensation of hardness signiﬁes·—is just this:
in the
former, the suggestion is the effect of habit and custom,
while in the second it is the effect not of habit but of the
basic constitution of our minds.

It seems evident from what I have said about language
that there are natural signs as well as artiﬁcial ones, and in
particular

•that the thoughts, purposes, and dispositions of the
mind have their natural signs in the features of the
face, the modulation of the voice, and the motion and
attitude of the body;
•that without a natural knowledge of the connection
between these signs and the things they signify, lan-
guage could never have been invented and established
among men; and
•that the ﬁne arts are all based on this connection,
which we may call the ‘natural language of mankind’.
Now it is time for me to remark that there are different orders
·or basic kinds· of natural signs, and to point out the ·three·
different classes into which they may be sorted. This will
help us to get a clearer conception of the relation between
our sensations and the things they suggest, and of what it
means to call sensations ‘signs of’ external things.

(1) First comes the class of natural signs such that the
connection of the sign with the thing signiﬁed is es-
tablished by nature, but discovered only by experience.
The whole of genuine philosophy consists in discovering

35

Inquiry into the Human Mind

Thomas Reid

Chapter 5: Touch

such connections and bringing them under general rules.
The great Francis Bacon perfectly understood this when he
called it ‘an interpretation of nature’. No man ever had a
clearer understanding than Bacon did of the nature and
basis of scientiﬁc endeavour, and no man ever described
it better. Everything that we know of mechanics, astron-
omy and optics—what is it but •connections established by
nature and discovered by experience or observation, and
•consequences deduced from them? All our knowledge of
agriculture, gardening, chemistry and medicine is built on
the same foundation. And if ever our study of the human
mind is get far enough to deserve to be called ‘science’
(which ought never to be despaired of), it will have to be
by observing facts, bringing them under general rules, and
drawing sound conclusions from them. [Reid here uses ‘science’
in the special sense—current in his day—of ‘discipline that is rigorous,
sharp, and highly organized under strong general principles’.] What
we commonly call ‘natural causes’ might more accurately
be called ‘natural signs’; and what we call ‘effects’ would
be better called ‘the things signiﬁed’. The causes have no
effectiveness or causality of their own, as far as we know; and
all we can say with certainty is that nature has established
a constant conjunction between them and the things we call
their ‘effects’, and has given to mankind a disposition to
notice those connections, to trust them to continue, and to
use them for the improvement of our knowledge and increase
of our power.

(2) Then there is the class of natural signs such that the
connection of the sign with the thing signiﬁed is established
by nature, and revealed to us through a natural force within
us, without reasoning or experience on our part. Of this
kind are the natural signs of human thoughts, purposes,
and desires, which I have already mentioned as ‘the natural
language of mankind’. An infant may be frightened by an

angry face and soothed again by smiles. A child that has
a good musical ear can be put to sleep or to dance, can
be made cheerful or sad, by the modulations of musical
sounds. The principles of all the ﬁne arts, and of what we
call a ‘ﬁne taste’, come down to connections of this kind. A
ﬁne taste can be •improved by reasoning and experience,
but it couldn’t be •acquired in the ﬁrst place if its basic
drivers weren’t planted in our minds by nature. Indeed, I
have already shown that much of this knowledge that we
have by nature is lost when we leave natural signs unused
and put artiﬁcial ones in their place.

(3) A third class of natural signs contains ones such that:
even if we never before had any notion or conception of the
thing signiﬁed, the signs do suggest it—conjure it up, as
it were, by a natural kind of magic—and at once give us
a conception of it and create in us a belief in it. I showed
earlier that our sensations suggest to us a sentient being or
mind to which they belong, a being which

•exists permanently although the sensations are tran-
sient and brief;
•remains the same while its sensations and other
operations are varied ten thousand ways;
•relates in the same way to all the endless variety of
thoughts, purposes, actions, affections, enjoyments
and sufferings that we are conscious of or can remem-
ber.

This conception of a mind is not an idea either of sensation or
of reﬂection, for it isn’t like any of our sensations or anything
we are ·reﬂectively· conscious of. The ﬁrst •conception of
it and of the common relation it bears to everything we are
conscious of or remember, and the •belief in it, are suggested
to every thinking being—we don’t know how.

We get the notion of hardness in bodies in the same
way as we get our belief in it, namely through a basic

36

Inquiry into the Human Mind

Thomas Reid

Chapter 5: Touch

force in our nature associated with the sensation that we
have when we feel a hard body. The sensation conveys
the notion of hardness and the belief in it so naturally and
unstoppably that until now they have been confused with
one another—·the sensation has been identiﬁed with the
property of hardness·—by the sharpest investigators of the
workings of human nature, despite the fact that when you
think about them carefully you’ll see that they are not merely
•different things but •as unalike as pain is unlike the point
of a sword.

It may be observed that •the ﬁrst class of natural signs I
have mentioned is the basis for real philosophy, •the second
is the basis of the ﬁne arts, or of taste, and •the third is the
basis of common sense—a part of human nature that has
never been explained. I take it for granted that the notion of
hardness and the belief in it are ﬁrst acquired through the
particular ·kind of· sensation that has invariably suggested
it as far back as we can remember; and that if we had never
had a feeling of that kind we would never have had any
notion of hardness.
I think it is obvious that reasoning
from our sensations won’t enable us to infer so much as
the existence of bodies, let alone any of their qualities. This
has been proved by unanswerable arguments by Berkeley
and Hume. It appears equally obvious that this connection
between our sensations and the conception of and belief
in things existing outside us can’t be produced by habit,
experience, upbringing or any ·other· force in human nature
that has been admitted by philosophers. At the same time,
it is a fact that such sensations are invariably connected
with the conception of and belief in external things. Thus,
by all the rules of sound reasoning we must conclude that
this connection is the effect of our constitution, and ought
to be considered as a basic force in human nature until we
ﬁnd some more general force of which it is a special case.

4. Hardness and other primary qualities

I add that hardness is a quality of which we have as clear
and distinct a conception as of anything whatsoever. We
perfectly understand

the cohesion [= ‘holding together’] of the parts of a body
with more or less force,

though we don’t understand its cause. We know what it is,
as well as how it affects the ·sense of· touch. So hardness
is a quality of a quite different order from the secondary
qualities I have discussed—qualities of which we know no
more, naturally, than that they cause certain sensations
in us. If hardness were a quality of that sort, it would be
appropriate for philosophers to ask ‘What is hardness?’, and
we would have various hypotheses about that, as we do
about colour and heat. But obviously any such hypothesis
would be ridiculous. If someone said that hardness in bodies
is a certain vibration of their parts, or that it is certain
efﬂuvia [see page 11] emitted by bodies that affect our ·sense
of· touch in the manner we feel, this would shock common
sense, because we all know that if the parts of a body hold
together strongly, it is hard even if it doesn’t vibrate or emit
efﬂuvia. But no-one can deny that efﬂuvia, or the vibration
of the parts of a body, could have affected our ·sense of·
touch in just the way that hardness now does, if the author
of our nature, ·God·, had chosen such an arrangement; and
if either of these hypotheses is used to explain a secondary
quality such as smell or taste or sound or colour or heat,
there seems to be no obvious absurdity in this.

The distinction between primary and secondary qualities
has had its ups and downs. Democritus and Epicurus and
their followers maintained it. Aristotle and the Peripatetics
abolished it. Descartes, Malebranche and Locke revived it
and were thought to have thrown bright light onto it. But

37

Inquiry into the Human Mind

Thomas Reid

Chapter 5: Touch

Berkeley again discarded this distinction on the basis of
arguments that must be convincing to people who hold the
accepted doctrine of ideas. Yet, after all, there seems to be a
real foundation for it in the workings of our nature.

What I have said about •hardness is so easily applicable
not only to its opposite, •softness, but also to •roughness and
•smoothness, to •shape and •motion, that I may be excused
from actually applying it to them, as this would only be a rep-
etition of what I have said about hardness. All these qualities
are presented to the mind, through certain corresponding
sensations of touch, as real external qualities; the conception
of and the belief in them are invariably connected with the
corresponding sensations, the connection being made by a
basic force in human nature. Their sensations have no name
in any language; they have been overlooked not only by the
vulgar but also by philosophers ·and scientists·; or if these
sensations have been at all taken notice of, they have been
confused with the external qualities that they suggest.

5. Extension

Notice also that hardness and softness, roughness and
smoothness, ﬁgure and motion all presuppose extension
and can’t be conceived without it. But on the other hand ·it
can’t be conceived without them·: it must be granted that
if we had never felt anything hard or soft, rough or smooth,
shaped or moved, we would never have had a conception
of extension. Thus, just as it is certain that the notion of
extension couldn’t be posterior to the notions of any of those
other qualities, because it is necessarily implied in them
all, so also there is good ground to believe that the notion
of extension couldn’t be prior to the notions of the other
primary qualities either.

Extension, therefore, seems to be a quality that is sug-
gested to us by the very same sensations that suggest the
other qualities I have mentioned. When I grasp a ball
in my hand, I perceive it at once as •hard, •shaped and
•extended. The feeling is very simple, and it doesn’t in the
least resemble any quality of body; yet it suggests to us
three primary qualities that are perfectly distinct from one
another as well as from the sensation that indicates them.
When I move my hand along the table, the feeling is so
simple that I can’t easily sort out different natures in it; yet
it immediately suggests •hardness, •smoothness, •extension
and •motion—things of very different natures, and all of them
as clearly understood as the feeling that suggests them.

Philosophers commonly tell us that we get the idea of
extension by feeling along the edges of a body, ·leaving it at
that· as though there were no sort of difﬁculty about this. I
confess to having tried very hard to ﬁnd out how this idea
can be acquired through feeling, but I haven’t succeeded.
And yet it is one of the clearest and most distinct notions we
have; and the human understanding can—·in the science
of geometry·—conduct more long and rigorous arguments
about extension than about anything else whatsoever. The
notion of extension is so familiar to us from infancy, and
so constantly pushed forward by everything we see and feel,
that we are apt to think it obvious how it comes into the
mind; but when we look more closely we’ll ﬁnd it utterly
inexplicable. We do have feelings of touch which every
moment present extension to the mind; but the question is:
How do they do this? Those feelings don’t resemble extension
any more than they resemble justice or courage! And the
existence of extended things can’t be inferred from those
feelings by any rules of reasoning. So the feelings we have
by touch can’t explain how we get the notion of extension or
how we come by the belief that there are extended things.

38

Inquiry into the Human Mind

Thomas Reid

Chapter 5: Touch

What has misled philosophers in this matter is the fact
that the feelings of touch which suggest primary qualities
don’t have names and are never thought about. They pass
through the mind instantaneously, and serve only to intro-
duce the notion of and belief in external things, which by
our constitution are connected with them. They are natural
signs, and the mind immediately passes to the thing signiﬁed
without giving the least thought to the sign, or even noticing
that there was any such thing. Hence it has always been
taken for granted that the ideas of extension, ﬁgure and
motion are ideas of sensation, which enter into the mind
by the sense of touch in the same way that sensations of
sound and smell enter by the ear and nose. . . . If we want
to reason clearly on this subject we should give names to
the feelings of touch, and should get used to attending to
them and reﬂecting on them, so that we may become able
to separate them from—and set them side by side in our
minds with—the qualities they signify or suggest. The habit
of doing this can’t be attained without effort and practice;
and until a man has acquired the habit he won’t be able to
think clearly or judge soundly on this subject.

Let a man press his hand against the table: he feels it
hard. But what does that mean? The meaning undoubtedly
is that he has a certain feeling of touch from which he
concludes, without any reasoning or inter-relating of ideas,
that there is really existing external to him something whose
parts stick together so ﬁrmly that they can’t be displaced
without considerable force.

There is here a •feeling and a •conclusion inferred from
it or in some way suggested by it. In order to inter-relate
these we must view them separately, and then consider what
tie there is that connects them, and in what respects they
resemble one another. The hardness of the table is the
conclusion, the feeling is what leads us to that conclusion.

Attend carefully to the feeling and to the conclusion, and
you’ll perceive them to be as unalike as any two things in
nature.

•One is a sensation of the mind, which can’t exist ex-
cept in a sentient being, and can’t exist for a moment
longer than it is felt; •the other is in the table, and we
easily conclude that it was in the table before it was
felt and continues there after the feeling is over. •One
implies no kind of extension, or parts, or cohesion;
•the other implies all of these.
It is true that the
sensation and the quality both admit of degrees, ·but
within that likeness there is another dissimilarity·:
•when the feeling gets beyond a certain degree it is
a sort of pain; but •absolute rock-hardness doesn’t
imply the least pain.

And just as the feeling has no resemblance to hardness, so
neither can our reason perceive the least tie or connection
between them; nor will the logician ever be able to show
a reason why we should infer hardness from this feeling,
rather than softness or any other quality whatsoever. But in
reality all mankind are led by their constitution to conclude
hardness from this feeling. The •sensation of heat and the
•sensation we have by pressing a hard body are equally
feelings, and we can’t by reasoning draw any conclusion
from one that couldn’t be drawn from the other; but our
constitution makes us conclude •from the ﬁrst an obscure or
hidden quality of which we have only the relative conception
of something that is capable of causing us to have the sensa-
tion of heat, and •from the second a quality of which we have
a clear and distinct conception, namely the hardness of the
body.

6. More on extension

To throw light on this matter from another angle, it may
be worthwhile to see whether from sensation alone we can
pick up any notion of extension, shape, motion and space. I
take it for granted that a blind man has the same notions of
extension, shape, and motion as a man who sees; that Dr.
Saunderson had the same notion of a cone, a cylinder and
a sphere, and of the motions and distances of the heavenly
bodies, as Sir Isaac Newton.

So sight isn’t needed for acquiring those notions, and I
shall leave it right out of my inquiry into the ﬁrst origin of
them. Let us consider a blind man who has some strange
illness that has caused him •to lose all the experience and
habits and notions he has acquired through touch, and
•to have not the least conception of the existence, shape,
dimensions, or extension of his own body or of anything else.
We are to suppose that he still has the complete power of
reason; and it is from reason and sensation that he has to
regain all his knowledge of external things. ·I shall look into
this in six stages, in the ﬁrst ﬁve of which· his body is ﬁxed
immovably in one place, so that he can have feelings of touch
only from other bodies that move in and touch it.

(1) He is pricked with a pin. This will no doubt give him
a smart sensation, a pain, but what can he infer from it?
Nothing, surely, with regard to the existence or shape of a
pin. From a pain of this sort he can’t infer anything that he
couldn’t just as well infer from gout or sciatica. Common
sense may lead him to think that this pain has a cause; but is
this cause body or spirit? extended or unextended? shaped
or not shaped? He can’t possibly form the least conjecture
about any of this from any principles we are supposing
him to have. Having formerly had no notion of body or of
extension, he can’t get one from the prick of a pin.
(2) A

blunt body is applied to his body with gradually increasing
force, until it bruises him. What has this given him but
another sensation or sequence of sensations, from which he
can’t infer anything more than he could from the pin-prick?
A hard cancer anywhere inside his body may, by pressing
on the adjacent parts, give the same kind of sensation as
the pressure of an external body, without conveying any
notion but that of pain, which surely has no resemblance to
extension.

(3) The body applied to him touches a larger or a smaller
part of his body. Can this give him any notion of its extension
or its size? To me it seems impossible for it to do so unless
he already has some notion of the size and shape of his own
body to serve him as a measure. When my two hands touch
the ends of a body; if I know them to be a foot apart I easily
infer that the body is a foot long; and if I know them to be
ﬁve feet apart, that it is ﬁve feet long: but if I don’t know how
far apart my hands are, I can’t know the length of the object
they are holding; and if I don’t even have a notion of hands
or of distance between hands, I can’t ever get that notion by
my hands’ being touched.

((4) A body is drawn across his hands or face while they
remain at rest. Can this give him any notion of space or
motion? No doubt it gives a new feeling; but I can’t conceive
how it could convey a notion of space or motion to someone
who previously had no such notion. Blood moves along the
arteries and veins, and when this motion is violent it is felt;
but I don’t think that a man who had no conception of space
or motion could get it from this feeling. Such a motion may
give a certain sequence of feelings, as colic may do; but no
feelings or combination of feelings can ever resemble space
or motion.

(5) The man makes some instinctive effort to move his
head or his hand, but no motion follows (his head or hand

is blocked, or he is paralysed). Can this effort convey the
notion of space and motion to someone who never had it
before? Surely it cannot.

(6) Finally: he moves a limb by instinct, without having
had any previous notion of space or motion. He has here a
new sensation which accompanies the ﬂexing of joints and
the swelling of muscles. But how this sensation can bring
into his mind the idea of space and motion is still altogether
mysterious and unintelligible. The motions of the heart
and lungs are all performed by the contraction of muscles,
but they don’t give any conception of space or motion. An
embryo in the womb has many such motions, and probably
the feelings that accompany them, without any idea of space
or motion.

Summing up: it seems that our philosophers have de-
ceived themselves and us in claiming to deduce from sensa-
tion the ﬁrst origin of our notions of external existing things,
of space, motion, and extension, and all the primary qualities
of body—that is, the qualities of which we have the most
clear and distinct conception. These qualities don’t at all ﬁt
with any theory of the human faculties that anyone has put
forward. They don’t resemble any sensation or any operation
of our minds; so they can’t be ideas either of sensation or of
reﬂection. The very conception of them can’t be reconciled
with the principles of any of our philosophical theories of the
understanding. Still less can the belief in them.

7. The existence of a material world

When and in what order did we come by our notions of
these ·primary· qualities? We don’t know. When we trace the
operations of our minds as far back as memory and reﬂection
can take us, we ﬁnd these qualities to be already dominating
our imagination and belief, and quite familiar to the mind;

but the questions

How did they ﬁrst come into contact with the mind?
What gave them such a strong hold on our belief? and
How much respect should we have for them?

are no doubt very important questions in the philosophy
·and science· of human nature.

Shall we join ·Berkeley·, the Bishop of Cloyne, in serving
them with a Quo warranto—·a legal challenge to their rights
and powers·—and have them tried at the bar of philosophy
on the strength of the laws of the ideal system? In this
trial they seem to have come off very pitifully. They had
very able counsel, learned in the law—namely Descartes,
Malebranche and Locke—who said everything they could on
behalf their clients; but the Bishop of Cloyne, believing them
to be aiders and abetters of heresy and schism, •prosecuted
them with great vigour, •fully answered everything that had
been pleaded in their defence, and •silenced their ablest
advocates, who seem for the past half-century to have
abandoned argument and trusted to the favour of the jury
rather than to the strength of their pleadings!

Thus, the wisdom of philosophy is set up against the com-
mon sense of mankind. Philosophy claims to demonstrate
a priori that •there can’t be any such thing as a material
world; that •sun, moon, stars and earth, and vegetable and
animal bodies can’t be anything but sensations in the mind,
or copies of those sensations in the memory and imagination;
that •like pain and joy they can’t exist when they are not
thought of. Common sense can’t avoid regarding this as a
kind of metaphysical lunacy. It concludes that too much
learning is apt to make men mad, and that anyone who
seriously entertains this belief, though in other respects he
may be a very good man. . . .surely has a soft place in his
understanding, and has been hurt by thinking too much.

41

Chapter 5: Touch

This opposition between philosophy and common sense
tends to have a bad effect on the philosopher himself. He
sees human nature in an odd, unfriendly and humiliating
light. He considers himself and philosophers in general as
•born under a necessity of believing countless absurdities
and contradictions, and as •endowed with a niggardly ration
of reason that is just sufﬁcient to make this miserable
discovery—and that’s all he gets from his profound spec-
ulations. Such notions of human nature tend to slacken
every nerve of the soul, to embarrass every noble purpose
and feeling, and to spread a melancholy gloom over the whole
face of things.

If this is wisdom, let me be deluded with the vulgar! I
ﬁnd something within me that recoils against it, and inspires
more respectful opinions about mankind and about the uni-
versal administration ·of God·. Common sense and reason
both have one author; that almighty author in whose other
works—all of them—we observe a consistency, uniformity
and beauty that charm and delight the understanding; so
there must be some order and consistency in the human
faculties as well as in other parts of God’s output. A man
who has a deeply respectful view of his own kind, and who
values true wisdom and philosophy, won’t be fond of such
strange and paradoxical opinions ·as those of Berkeley·;
indeed he will be very suspicious of them. If they are false,
they disgrace philosophy; and if they are true, they degrade
the human species and make us rightly ashamed of being as
we are.

What is the point of philosophy’s deciding against com-
mon sense on this or any other topic? The belief in a
material world is older, and has more authority, than any
principles of philosophy. It rejects the tribunal of reason,
and laughs at all the artillery of the logician. It keeps its
supreme authority in spite of all the edicts of philosophy, and

reason itself must bow down and obey its commands. Even
the philosophers who have disowned the authority of our
notions of an external material world admit that they ﬁnd
themselves having to submit to the power of those notions.
So I think it would be better to make a virtue of necessity!
Since can’t get rid of the vulgar notion of and belief in an
external world, let us reconcile our reason to it as well as we
can; for Reason can’t throw off this yoke, however resentful
and fretful it makes her; if she refuses to be the •servant of
Common Sense she will have to be her •slave.

In order to reconcile reason to common sense in this
matter, I venture to offer two thoughts for philosophers to
consider.

(1) In all this debate about the existence of a material
world, it has been taken for granted on both sides that •if
there is a material world it must be exactly like our sensa-
tions; that •we can’t have any conception of a material thing
that isn’t like some sensation in our minds; and in particular
that •the sensations of touch are like extension, hardness,
shape and motion. All Berkeley’s and Hume’s arguments
against the existence of a material world presuppose this. If
this presupposition is true, their arguments are conclusive
and unanswerable; but if it isn’t true, there is no shadow
of argument left. Well, then, have those philosophers given
any solid proof of this hypothesis on which rests the whole
weight of the strange system ·according to which there is
no material world·? No. They haven’t even tried to do it,
and have merely taken it for granted because ancient and
modern philosophers have accepted it. But let us do what
philosophers should do—set aside ·appeals to· authority.
Surely we don’t need to consult Aristotle or Locke to know
whether pain is like the point of a sword! I have as clear
a conception of •extension, hardness and motion as I have
of the point of a sword; and if I work at it and practice,

42

Inquiry into the Human Mind

Thomas Reid

Chapter 5: Touch

I can form as clear a notion of •the other sensations of
touch as I have of pain. When I do so, and compare them
together—·i.e. survey in my thought •those qualities and
•the sensations that signify them·—it appears to me clear as
daylight that the qualities are not kindred to the sensations
and don’t resemble them in any respect. They are as unlike
one another—indeed, as certainly and plainly unlike—as are
pain and the point of a sword. It may be true that those
sensations ﬁrst brought the material world to our knowledge;
it may be true that it seldom or never appears except in
company with them; but still they are as unalike as the
passion of anger is unlike the facial expressions that go with
it.

So that when those philosophers have passed sentence
on the material world, there has been a case of mistaken
identity [Reid uses the Latin legal term error personae]. Their proof
doesn’t get to matter or to any of its qualities, and strikes
directly against an idol of their own imagination, a ‘material
world’ made of ideas and sensations—a world that never did
and never can exist.

(2) Our conceptions of extension, shape and motion are
not ideas of sensation or of reﬂection, so the mere fact that
they exist overturns the whole ideal system by which the
material world has been tried and condemned; so that in
this sentence ·that Hume and Berkeley have passed on the
material world· there is an error in law [Reid: an error juris].
Locke made a very ﬁne and sound observation, namely that
just as •no human skill can create a single particle of matter,
and our only power over the material world is a power to
compound, combine and disconnect the matter that comes
to our hands, so •in the world of thought the materials are
all made by nature and can only be variously connected and
disconnected by us. It follows from this that it is impossible
for reason or prejudice, true or false philosophy, to produce

one simple notion or conception that isn’t the work of nature
and a result of how we are built. The conception of extension,
motion and the other attributes of matter can’t be the effect
of error or prejudice; it must be the work of nature. And the
power or faculty through which we acquire those conceptions
must be something other than any power of the human
mind that has been explained ·by philosophers up to now·,
because it isn’t sensation and isn’t reﬂection.

I humbly propose this as a decisive test by which the
ideal system must stand or fall, settling this argument before
it drags on for too long. Either they—·our conceptions of the
qualities of matter·—are ideas of sensation, or they are not.
•If even one of them can be shown to be an idea of sensation,
or to have some slight resemblance to any sensation, I’ll lay
my hand on my mouth, give up all attempts to reconcile
reason with common sense in this matter, and allow the
scepticism of the ideal system to triumph. But •if they are
not ideas of sensation and not like any sensation, then the
ideal system is a rope of sand and all the laboured arguments
of the sceptical philosophy—against a material world and
against the existence of everything but impressions and
ideas—are based on a false hypothesis.

If our philosophy concerning the mind is so feeble regard-
ing the origin of our notions of the clearest, simplest and
most familiar objects of thought and the powers from which
they are derived, can we expect it to do better in its account of
the origin of our opinions and belief? We have seen already
examples of its imperfection in this respect. Perhaps the
same ·human· nature that •enables us to conceive things
that are altogether unlike any of our sensations or any
operation of our minds •has likewise provided for our belief
in them, through some part of our constitution that hasn’t
yet been explained.

43

Inquiry into the Human Mind

Thomas Reid

Chapter 5: Touch

Bishop Berkeley has proved beyond the possibility of reply
that we cannot by reasoning infer the existence of •matter
from our sensations; and Hume has proved no less clearly
that we cannot by reasoning infer the existence of •our own
or other minds from our sensations. Are we then to accept
nothing but what can be proved by reasoning? If so, we must
be sceptics indeed, and believe nothing at all. Hume seems
to me to be only a half sceptic, because he hasn’t followed
his principles as far as they go. With unparalleled boldness
and success he combats vulgar prejudices; then, when he
has only one last one blow to strike, his courage fails him
and he openly lays down his arms and surrenders himself
as a captive to the most common of all vulgar prejudices, I
mean the belief in the existence of his own impressions and
ideas.

Please let me have the honour of adding something to the
sceptical system—something without which I don’t think it
can hang together. I afﬁrm that the belief in the existence of
impressions and ideas is not supported by reason any more
than is the belief in the existence of minds and bodies. No
man ever did—no man ever could—give any reason for this
belief. Descartes took it for granted that he •thought and
•had sensations and ideas; so have all his followers done.
Even ·Hume· the hero of scepticism has followed suit, I beg
leave to say, weakly and imprudently. I say this because I am
convinced that no principle of his philosophy obliged him to
make this concession ·that impressions and ideas exist·. And
what makes impressions and ideas so formidable that this
all-conquering philosophy ·of Hume’s·, after triumphing over
every other kind of existent, should pay homage to them?
As well ·as being weak and imprudent· the concession is
dangerous; for it’s just a fact about belief that if you leave
any root it will spread; and you’ll ﬁnd it easier to pull it up
altogether than to say: ‘You may go this far, but no further; I

concede to you the existence of impressions and ideas, but
see to it that you don’t claim anything else!’ So a thorough
and consistent sceptic will never concede the existence of
ideas and impressions; and as long as he refuses to do so
you can never oblige him to concede anything else.

To such a sceptic I have nothing to say; but I ask the
semi-sceptics: ‘Why do you believe in the existence of your
impressions and ideas?’ The true reason I take to be because
they can’t help it; ·but if they give that reason, they should
stop being even semi-sceptics, because· that same reason
will lead them to believe many other things.

All reasoning must be from ﬁrst principles; and the only
reason that can be given for ·accepting· a ﬁrst principle
is that because of how we are constituted we can’t help
assenting to it. Such principles are as much parts of our
constitution as is our power of thinking; reason can’t make
them or destroy them. And it can’t do anything without
them: it is like a telescope, which can help a sighted man to
see further, but can’t show anything to a man who has no
eyes. A mathematician can’t prove the truth of his axioms,
and he can’t prove anything else unless he takes his axioms
for granted. We can’t prove the existence of our minds,
or even the existence of our thoughts and sensations. An
historian or a witness can’t prove anything unless it is taken
for granted that memory and the senses can be trusted. A
natural philosopher can’t prove anything unless it is taken
for granted that the course of nature is steady and uniform.
How and when did I ﬁrst get such ﬁrst principles, on
which I build all my reasoning? I don’t know, because I
had them further back than I can remember; but I am
sure they are parts of my constitution and that I can’t
discard them. That our thoughts and sensations must
have a subject—·must be the thoughts and sensations of
something·—which we call ourself
is not, therefore, an

44

Inquiry into the Human Mind

Thomas Reid

Chapter 5: Touch

•opinion acquired through reasoning, but a •natural prin-
ciple. That our sensations of touch indicate something
external, extended, shaped, hard or soft, is not something
inferred by reason but a natural principle. The •belief
in it—·i.e.
in an external material world·—and the very
•conception of it are equally parts of our constitution. If we
are deceived about it, we are deceived by ·God·, him who
made us, and there is no remedy.

I don’t mean to say that in a newborn baby the sensations
of touch suggest the same notions of body and its qualities
that they do when we are grown up. Perhaps nature is
frugal—·sparing·—in this, as in her other operations. The
passion of love, with all its associated feelings and desires,
is naturally suggested by the perception of beauty in the
other sex. But this perception doesn’t suggest the tender
passion until one has reached a certain age. A blow given to
an infant creates grief and wailing; but when he grows up it
equally naturally arouses resentment and prompts him to
resist. Perhaps a child in the womb, or for some short period
after birth, is merely a sentient being ·and not a thinking
one·. Perhaps the faculties by which it •perceives an external
world, by which it •reﬂects on its own thoughts and existence
and relation to other things, as well as its reasoning and
moral faculties, unfold themselves gradually; so that it is
inspired with the various principles of common sense—as
it is with the passions of love and resentment—when it has
occasion for them.

8. The systems of philosophers concerning the
senses

All the systems of philosophers concerning our senses and
their objects have split on the same rock—namely, not
properly distinguishing •sensations that can’t exist except

when they are felt from the •things suggested by them.
Aristotle, who was as given to making distinctions as anyone
who ever tackled philosophical problems, confuses these
two. He holds that every sensation is the form without the
matter of the thing that is perceived through it. Just as the
impression of a seal on wax has the •form of the seal but
nothing of its •matter, so our sensations (Aristotle thought)
are impressions on the mind which bear the image, likeness
or •form of the external thing that is perceived, without the
•matter of it. According to him:

•Colour, sound and smell, as well as extension, shape
and hardness are various forms of matter; and
•Our sensations are the same forms imprinted on the
mind, and perceived in its own intellect.

It is obvious from this that Aristotle didn’t distinguish be-
tween primary and secondary qualities of bodies, although
that distinction was made by Democritus, Epicurus and
others of the ancients. Descartes, Malebranche and Locke
revived the distinction between primary and secondary quali-
ties. But they made the secondary qualities mere sensations,
and the primary ones resemblances of our sensations. They
maintained that colour, sound and heat are not anything in
bodies, but are sensations of the mind; at the same time they
acknowledged that •some particular texture or state of the
body is the cause or occasion of those sensations; but they
didn’t give •it a name. In contrast with what these philoso-
phers have said, the vulgar seldom apply the names ‘colour’,
‘heat’ and ‘sound’ to their sensations, usually applying them
to those unknown causes of them (as I explained ·in chapter
2, section 8·). We are so constituted that we are more apt
to attend to •the things signiﬁed by a sensation than to •the
sensation itself, and to give a name to the former rather than
to the latter. Thus we see that with regard to secondary
qualities, these philosophers thought with the vulgar and

45

Inquiry into the Human Mind

Thomas Reid

Chapter 5: Touch

with common sense. Their paradoxes were only a misuse of
words. For when they maintain, as an important modern
discovery, that there is no heat in the ﬁre they mean only
that the ﬁre doesn’t feel heat, which everyone knew already!
·They actually agree with the vulgar that there is in the ﬁre
something that causes sensations of heat·.

With regard to primary qualities these philosophers erred
more grossly. They did believe in the existence of those
qualities; but they paid no attention to the sensations that
suggest the qualities—sensations which, because they have
no names, have been ignored as though they also had no
existence. The philosophers were aware that shape, exten-
sion and hardness are perceived by means of sensations
of touch, and this led them to the rash conclusion that
these sensations must be images and resemblances of shape,
extension and hardness. The accepted hypothesis of ideas
naturally led them to this conclusion; indeed it can’t be made
consistent with any other; for, according to that hypothesis,
external things must be perceived by means of images [=
‘likenesses’] of them in the mind; and what can those images
of external things in the mind be if not the sensations by
which we perceive them?

But they were drawing a conclusion from an hypoth-
esis ·that is· against fact. We don’t need to consult any
hypothesis to know what our sensations are or what they
resemble. By appropriately reﬂecting and paying attention
we can understand them perfectly, and be as certain •that
they aren’t like any quality of body as we can be •that a
toothache isn’t like a triangle. How can a sensation instantly
make us conceive an external thing altogether unlike it, and
believe in the thing’s existence? I don’t claim to know; and
when I say that one ‘suggests’ the other, I don’t mean this
as explaining how they are connected, but only to express
a fact of which everyone can be conscious, namely that by

a law of our nature such a conception and belief constantly
and immediately follow the sensation.

Bishop Berkeley threw new light on this subject when he
showed •that the qualities of an inanimate thing, such as
matter is thought of as being, can’t resemble any sensation;
•that it is impossible to conceive anything like the sensations
of our minds except the sensations of other minds. Everyone
who attends properly to his sensations must agree with this,
yet it had escaped all the philosophers who came before
Berkeley; it had escaped even the ingenious Locke, who had
reﬂected so much on the operations of his own mind. That
shows how hard it is to attend properly even to our own
feelings. We are so accustomed to their passing through
the mind unobserved, instantly making way for whatever
nature intended them to signify, that it is extremely difﬁcult
to stop them and attend to them; and when we think we
have become able to do this, perhaps the mind still ﬂuctuates
between the •sensation and its associated •quality, so that
they mix together and present to the imagination something
compounded of both. Thus in a globe or cylinder whose
opposite sides are quite unalike in colour, if you turn it
slowly the colours are perfectly distinguishable, and their
unlikeness to one another is obvious; but if you turn it
quickly the colours lose their differences and seem to be
all the same. ·That is one example of the general fact that
•speed tends to mask differences·.

No succession can be •faster than the way in which
·thoughts of· tangible qualities succeed the sensations with
which nature has associated them. But once you have
acquired the knack of making them separate and distinct
objects of thought, you will then clearly perceive that the
above-mentioned maxim of Berkeley’s is self-evident. . . .

But look at how Berkeley uses this important discovery!
He concludes that we can have no conception of an inanimate

46

Inquiry into the Human Mind

Thomas Reid

Chapter 5: Touch

substance such as matter is conceived to be, or of any of its
qualities; and that there is the strongest reason to believe
that nothing exists in nature but minds, sensations and
ideas.
If there exists any other kind of thing, it must be
something that we don’t and can’t have any conception of.
But how does this follow? This is how:

•We can have no conception of anything except what
resembles some sensation or idea in our minds;
•the sensations and ideas in our minds can resemble
nothing but the sensations and ideas in other minds;
therefore. . . and so on. This argument, we see, has two
premises. The second of them the ingenious author has in-
deed made obvious to all that understand his reasoning and
can attend to their own sensations; but he never attempts to
prove the ﬁrst premise. It is taken from the doctrine of ideas
that has been so universally accepted by philosophers that
it was thought not to need any proof.

I would point out, yet again, that this acute writer argues
from a hypothesis ·that is· against fact and against the
common sense of mankind. The opinion that we can have
no conception of anything unless our minds contain some
impression, sensation or idea that resembles it has indeed
been very generally accepted among philosophers; but it isn’t
self-evident, nor has it been clearly proved; so calling it in
question would have been more reasonable than discarding
the material world, thereby exposing philosophers to the
ridicule of everyone who refuses to offer up common sense
as a sacriﬁce to metaphysics.

But we ought in fairness to grant to Berkeley and Hume
that their conclusions are soundly drawn from the doctrine

of ideas, which has been so universally accepted. On the
other hand, judging by the ·personal· character of Berkeley
and of his predecessors Descartes, Locke and Malebranche,
I venture to say that if they had seen all the consequences of
this doctrine as clearly as Hume did, they would have been
thoroughly suspicious of it and would have examined it more
carefully than they appear to have done.

The theory of ideas, like the Trojan horse, appeared
superﬁcially to be both innocent and beautiful; but if those
philosophers had known that in its belly it carried death and
destruction to all science and common sense, they wouldn’t
have broken down their walls to let it in.

We have clear and distinct conceptions of extension,
shape, motion and other attributes of body, attributes
that are neither sensations nor like any sensation

—that is a fact of which we can be as certain as we are of the
fact that we have sensations. Furthermore:

All mankind have a ﬁxed belief in an external material
world, a belief that is not acquired through reasoning
or upbringing, a belief that we can’t shake off even
when we seem to have strong arguments against it
and no shadow of argument for it

—that is another fact, for which we have all the evidence that
the nature of the thing admits. These facts are phenomena
of human nature, from which we may soundly argue against
any hypothesis, however generally accepted. But to argue
·not from •facts against a •hypothesis but· from a •hypothesis
against •facts is contrary to the rules of true philosophy.

Chapter 6: Seeing

1. The excellence and dignity of this faculty

The advances made in the knowledge of optics in the last
age and in the present—chieﬂy the discoveries of Sir Isaac
Newton—reﬂect credit not only on philosophy [here = ‘science’]
but also on human nature. Such discoveries ought for ever
to put to shame the low attempts of our modern sceptics to
downgrade the human understanding and to discourage men
in their search for truth by representing the human faculties
as no good for anything except to lead us into absurdities
and contradictions.

Sight is certainly the noblest of the faculties called ‘the
ﬁve senses’. The rays of light that serve this sense, and
that we couldn’t have had the least conception of if we didn’t
have this sense, are the most wonderful and astonishing
part of the inanimate creation. We must be sure of this if we
consider

•their extreme minuteness,
•their inconceivable speed,
•the regular variety of colours that they exhibit,
•the invariable laws according to which they are acted
on by other bodies that reﬂect, diffract and refract
them without changing their intrinsic properties, and
•the ease with which they pervade bodies of great
density and of the closest texture (·bodies such as
clear glass·): they aren’t resisted, they don’t crowd or
disturb one another, and yet they don’t push around
even the lightest bodies.

The structure of the eye and of all its accessories, the
admirable way in which nature has provided for it to perform
all its various external and internal motions, and the way

the eyes of different animals vary according to their various
natures and ways of life—all this clearly demonstrates the
eye to be one of nature’s masterpieces. Someone who can
seriously wonder whether the rays of light and the eye were
made for one another—made with utter wisdom and perfect
skill in optics—must either be very ignorant of what has
been discovered about this or have a very strange kind of
understanding.

Let us (·through this and the next two paragraphs·) imag-
ine beings who have every human faculty but that of sight.
How incredible it would appear to them, accustomed as they
would be only to the slow input of information through touch,
that by the addition of an organ consisting of a ball and
socket of an inch diameter they could in an instant of time,
without moving about, perceive the disposition of a whole
army or the order of a battle, the shape of a magniﬁcent
palace, or all the variety of a landscape? If a man tried to
discover through touch the shape of the peak of Teneriffe or
even of St. Peter’s church in Rome, it would be the work of a
lifetime!

It would seem even more incredible to the beings we are
imagining if they were informed of the discoveries that can
be made by this little organ in things far beyond the reach
of any other sense. That by means of it we can ﬁnd our way
in the pathless ocean; that we can go around the globe of
the earth, discover its shape and dimensions and mark out
every region of it. Indeed, that we can measure the planets
and make discoveries as far away as the ﬁxed stars.

Wouldn’t it seem still more astonishing to our imagined
beings if they were also told that by means of this same
organ we can perceive our fellow-creatures’ moods and

48

Inquiry into the Human Mind

Thomas Reid

6: Seeing

dispositions, passions and affections, even when they most
want to conceal them? That when the tongue is taught most
skillfully to lie and conceal, the hypocrisy will show in the
face to a discerning eye? And that by this organ we can
often perceive what is straight and what is crooked in the
mind as well as in the body? If a blind man is to trust the
reports of sighted people, what a lot of mysterious things
he will have to believe! Surely he will need as strong a faith
as is required of a good Christian. So there is good reason
for the faculty of seeing to be regarded not only as •nobler
than the other senses but as •being in some way higher than
mere sensation. When reason makes something evident to
us we call this ‘seeing’—·how an argument works, that an
explanation is confused·—not feeling, smelling or tasting.
Indeed, we are given to speaking of God’s knowledge as a
matter of ‘seeing’, because this is the kind of knowledge that
is most perfect in us.

2. Sight reveals almost nothing that the blind can’t
comprehend. The reason for this

Despite what I have said about the dignity and superior
nature of this faculty, we should bear in mind that almost
all of the knowledge acquired by sight can be communicated
to ·and thus understood by· a man born blind. Someone
who never saw light may be learned and knowledgeable in
every science, even in optics; and may make discoveries in
every branch of philosophy. He may understand as much as
anyone else not only about the order, distances and motions
of the heavenly bodies but about the nature of light and the
laws of the reﬂection and refraction of its rays. He may have
a ﬁrm grasp of how those laws produce the phenomena of
the rainbow, the prism, the camera obscura and the magic
lantern, and all the powers of the microscope and telescope.

This is a fact sufﬁciently attested by experience. [Reid’s use
of ‘visible’ from here on calls for comment. Ordinarily to call a thing
‘visible’ is to say that it can be seen; but when Reid speaks of the ‘visible
appearance’ of something he doesn’t mean that the appearance is seen.
He knows as well as we do that what is seen is the object ‘suggested’
In order to see why it is so, we must
by the appearance.]
distinguish the •appearance that objects make to the eye
from the •things suggested by that appearance; and we must
make a distinction within the visible appearance of objects,
between the •appearance of colour and the •appearance of
extension, shape and motion. Starting then with the visible
appearance of the shape, motion and extension of bodies,
I think that a man born blind can have a clear notion if
not of those appearances themselves at least of something
extremely like them. Can’t a blind man be made to conceive
that

•a body moving directly from the eye or directly toward
it may appear to be at rest?
•the same motion may appear quicker or slower de-
pending on whether it is nearer to the eye or further
off, more direct or more oblique?
•a plane surface with a certain orientation may appear
as a straight line, and vary its apparent shape as its
orientation or that of the eye is varied?
•a circle seen obliquely will appear an ellipse; and a
square seen obliquely will appear a rhombus or an
oblong rectangle?

[‘Orientation’ here replaces Reid’s ‘position’. He uses ‘position’ in this
sense in sections 2-4, 7, 11-12. A few occurrences might mean ‘orien-
tation’ but might mean ‘place’.] Dr. Saunderson understood the
projection of the sphere and the common rules of perspective,
so he must have understood all the facts that I have listed. In
case you have doubts about Dr. Saunderson’s understanding
of these things, I report that I once heard him talk about the

proposition that

the angles made by the circles of the sphere are equal
to the angles made by their representatives in the
stereographic projection.

He said that had great difﬁculty understanding Dr. Halley’s
demonstration of that proposition; but ‘when I laid aside that
demonstration and considered the proposition in my own
way, I saw clearly that it must be true’. . . .

A blind man must be more at a loss regarding •the
appearance of colour because he has no perception that
resembles •it. Yet he may partly make up for this lack by a
kind of analogy. To those who see,

a scarlet colour signiﬁes an unknown quality in bodies
that gives to the eye an appearance that they are well
acquainted with and have often observed;

whereas to a blind man

a scarlet colour signiﬁes an unknown quality that
gives to the eye an appearance that he is not ac-
quainted with.

But he can conceive the eye to be differently affected by
different colours, as the nose is by different smells, or the
ear by different sounds. Thus he can conceive •scarlet to
differ from •blue as •the sound of a trumpet differs from •the
sound of a drum or as •the smell of an orange differs from
•the smell of an apple. It is impossible to know whether a
scarlet colour has the same appearance to me as to someone
else, and if the appearances of it to different persons differed
as much as colour does from sound, we might never be able
to discover this difference. So it seems obvious that a blind
man might talk about colours, clearly and relevantly, for
a long time; and if you quizzed him in the dark about the
nature, composition and beauty of colours, he might be able
to answer without giving away the fact that he is blind.

We have seen how much a blind man can come to know
about the appearances that things make to the eye. As to
the ·external· things that are suggested by or inferred from
those appearances, although he could never discover them
on his own he may still understand them perfectly when
others inform him about them. Everything of this sort that
enters into our minds by the eye may enter into his by the
ear. Thus, for instance, if left to the direction of his own
faculties he could never have dreamed of any such thing as
light; but he can be informed of everything we know about
it. He can conceive as clearly as we can the minuteness and
velocity of its rays, the different degrees to which they can
be refracted and reﬂected, and all the magical powers and
virtues of that wonderful element. He could never have found
out for himself that there are such bodies as the sun, moon
and stars; but he can be informed of all the noble discoveries
of astronomers concerning the motions of these bodies and
the laws of nature that regulate them. It seems, then, that
there is very little knowledge acquired through the eye that
couldn’t be communicated by language to those who have
no eyes.

Suppose it were as uncommon for men to see as it is
in fact for men to be born blind.
In that case, wouldn’t
the few who had this rare gift appear as prophets and
inspired teachers to the many? Think about how we conceive
inspiration:

We think of a man’s inspiration not as a new faculty,
but as something that communicates to him in a new
way, and by extraordinary means, •what the faculties
common to mankind can take in and apprehend, and
•what he can communicate to others by ordinary
means.

On the present supposition ·of sightedness as rare and
blindness as the norm·, sight would appear to the blind

50

Inquiry into the Human Mind

Thomas Reid

6: Seeing

to be very similar to this; for the few who had this gift
could communicate the knowledge acquired by it to those
who lacked it. They couldn’t convey to the blind any clear
notion of how they acquired this knowledge: to these blind
people •a ball in a socket (·which is what an eye is·) would
seem as unsuitable for acquiring such a variety and extent
of knowledge as •a dream or •a vision. How a sighted
man detects so many things by means of the eye is as
unintelligible to the blind as how a man can be inspired
with knowledge by God is unintelligible to us. Should this
lead the blind man to dismiss as fraudulent all claims to be
able to see, without putting them to any test? If he were
fair and open-minded, mightn’t he ﬁnd reasonable evidence
of the reality of this gift of eyesight in others, and get great
advantages from it for himself?

To get a sound notion of nature’s intention in giving us
eyes, we must invoke the distinction I have drawn between
•the visible appearances of the objects of sight and •things
suggested by them. If we pay proper attention to how our
mind operates in our use of this faculty, we shall become
aware that •the visible appearance of objects is something
we hardly ever notice. We don’t think about it or reﬂect on
it; all it does for us is to serve as a sign to introduce to the
mind •something else, something that could also be clearly
conceived by people who never saw.

Thus, the visible appearance of things in my room varies
almost every hour depending on whether the day is clear
or cloudy, whether the sun is in the east or south or west,
whether my eye is in one part of the room or in another;
but I never think about these variations as anything but
signs of a clear or cloudy sky or of morning, noon, or night.
A book or a chair has appears differently to the eye from
different distances and seen at different angles; yet we think
of it as still the same; and, overlooking the ·varying· appear-

ance, we immediately conceive the real shape, distance and
orientation of the body, of which its visible or perspective
appearance is a sign and indication.

When I see a man at a distance of ten yards and later at a
hundred yards, his visible appearance in its length, breadth
and all its linear proportions is ten times less in the second
case than in the ﬁrst, but I don’t think of him as one inch
shorter because of this lessening of his visible appearance.
Indeed, I pay no attention at all to this lessening, even when I
draw from it the conclusion that he is now further away. For
such is the subtlety of the mind’s operation in this case that
we draw the •conclusion without noticing that the •premises
ever entered the mind! A thousand such instances might be
produced, to show that the visible appearances of objects
are intended by nature only as signs or indications; and that
the mind passes instantly to the things that are signiﬁed,
without reﬂecting in the least on the sign or even noticing
that there is any such thing. In something like the same way,
if we are familiar with a language we overlook its sounds
and attend only to the things signiﬁed by them. So Berkeley
said something true and important when he remarked that
the visible appearance of objects is a kind of language used
by nature to inform us of objects’ distance, size and shape.
And that ingenious writer has made good use of this point in
explaining some phenomena in optics which had previously
perplexed the greatest masters in that science. The point
is further improved upon by the judicious Dr. Smith in his
Optics, for explaining the apparent shape of the sky and the
apparent distances and sizes of objects seen with glasses, or
by the naked eye.

Trying not to repeat what has been said by these excellent
writers, I shall avail myself of the distinction between •the
signs that nature uses in this ‘visual language’ and •the
things signiﬁed by them. Let us start with the signs.

3. The visible appearances of objects

appearance from the art of painting.

In this section I have to talk about things that are never made
the object of reﬂection, although at almost every moment
they are presented to the mind. Nature intended them
only as signs, and throughout our lives that is all we use
them for. The mind has acquired an ingrained habit of
inattention to them: no sooner do they appear than—quick
as lightning—the thing signiﬁed takes over and occupies all
our attention. Although we are conscious of the appearances
when they pass through the mind, their passage is so fast
and so familiar that it is absolutely unnoticed; and they
leave no footsteps of themselves in the memory or in the
imagination. They have no name in ·any· language.
I
showed in chapter 5 that all this holds with regard to the
sensations of •touch; well, it holds just as much for the
•visible appearances of objects.

So I haven’t the slightest hope of being intelligible to
readers who haven’t through effort and practice acquired
the habit of distinguishing •the appearances of objects to
the eye from •the judgments that we form (on the basis of
those appearances) of their colour, distance, size, and shape.
The only profession in life where this distinction has to be
made is that of painting. The painter has a need for an
abstraction regarding visible objects somewhat similar to
what we need here, and this is indeed the most difﬁcult
part of his art. For it is obvious that if he could ﬁx in his
imagination the visible appearance of objects, not confusing
it with the things it signiﬁes, it would be as easy for him to
•paint from the life—giving every ﬁgure its proper shading
and relief, and its perspectival proportions—as to •paint from
a copy. Perspectival shading, giving relief, and colouring
are merely copying the appearance that things make to the
eye. So we may borrow some light on the subject of visible

Look at any familiar object, perhaps a book, at different
distances and with different orientations; can’t you say on
the testimony of your sight that it is the same book, whether
seen from one foot away or from ten, whether with one
orientation or another? That the colour is the same, the
dimensions the same, and the shape the same, as far as
your eye can judge? Surely you will answer Yes. Well,
then, we have one individual object presented to the mind
from different distances and in different positions. Does
this object have the same appearance to the eye at these
different distances? Quite certainly it does not. Here are
·four· reasons for saying this.

(1) However certain our judgment may be that the colour
is the same, it is equally certain that it doesn’t have the
same appearance at different distances. There is a certain
degradation of the colour, and a certain confusion and
indistinctness of the minute parts, which naturally results
from the object’s being moved to a greater distance. Those
who are not painters or critics of painting overlook this fact,
and can’t easily be persuaded that the colour of one object
has a different appearance at a distance of one foot and
of ten, in the shade and in the light. But the masters of
painting know how to degrade the colour and the confuse
the minute parts so that ﬁgures that on the same canvas
and at the same distance from the eye are made to represent
objects that are at very different distances. They know how to
make the objects appear to be of the same colour by making
their pictures really of different colours depending on their
distances or shades.

(2) Everyone who knows the rules of perspective knows
that the appearance of the shape of the book must vary with
every different orientation; but if you ask a man who has no
notion of perspective ‘Doesn’t the shape of the book appear

52

Inquiry into the Human Mind

Thomas Reid

6: Seeing

to your eye to be the same in all its different orientations?’ he
can with good conscience answer that it does. He has learned
to make allowances for the variety of visible shapes arising
from the difference of orientation, and to draw the proper
conclusions from it. But he draws these conclusions so
smoothly and habitually that he loses sight of the premises;
so when he has concluded that the shape has remained the
same he thinks that the visible appearance must also have
been the same.

(3) Let us consider the apparent size or dimensions of
the book. Seen from one foot away or from ten, it seems
to be about seven inches long, ﬁve wide, and one thick. I
can judge these dimensions pretty accurately by the eye,
and I judge them to be the same at both distances. Yet it
is certain that at the distance of one foot its visible length
and breadth are about ten times as great as they are at
the distance of ten feet; so its ·visible· surface is about a
hundred times as great. This great change in apparent size
is overlooked entirely, and everyone is apt to imagine that it
appears to the eye to be of the same size at both distances.
Furthermore, when I look at the book it seems plainly to
have three dimensions—length, width, and thickness—but it
is certain that the visible appearance has no more than two
and can be exactly represented on a canvas that has only
length and width.

(4) Doesn’t everyone, by sight, perceive the distance of the
book from his eye? Can’t he afﬁrm with certainty that in one
case it isn’t more than one foot away and that in another it is
ten? Nevertheless, it appears certain that distance from the
eye is not an immediate object of sight. Certain things in the
visible appearance are signs of distance from the eye, and
I’ll show later that from these signs we learn by experience
to estimate that distance within certain limits. ·I emphasize
‘by experience·: it seems beyond doubt that a man who had

been born blind and was suddenly made to see could not
at ﬁrst form any judgment about the distance of the objects
that he saw. The young man couched by Cheselden thought
at ﬁrst that everything he saw touched his eye, and learned
only by experience to judge of the distance of visible objects.
[Couching was a surgical procedure—displacing the opaque lens of the
eye downwards into the vitreous by means of a needle.]

I have gone into all this detail in order •to show that the
visible appearance of an object is very different from the
notion of the object that experience teaches us to form by
sight, and •to enable you to attend to the visible appearance
of colour, shape and extension in visible things. Such an
appearance is not a common object of thought, but it must
be carefully attended to by those who want to enter into
the philosophy ·and science· of the visual sense, or want to
understand what others say about it. To a man who had
just gained eyesight the •visible appearance of objects would
be the same as to us, but he wouldn’t see anything of their
•real sizes as we do. With only his sight to go by, he couldn’t
form any conjecture concerning how many inches or feet
they were in length, breadth or thickness. He could perceive
little or nothing of their real shape; nor could he tell that
this was a cube and that a sphere, that this was a cone
and that a cylinder. His eye couldn’t inform him that this
object was near and that one further away. The clothing of
a man or of a woman, appearing to us to be of one uniform
colour but variously folded and shaded, would present to
his eye no fold, no shading, but a variety of colour. In short,
however perfect his eyes were they would at ﬁrst give him
almost no information about things in his environment. They
would present the same appearances to him as they do to us,
and speak the same ‘language’ ·as Berkeley called it·; but to
him it would be an unknown language, ·a foreign tongue·;
and therefore he would attend only to the signs themselves

53

Inquiry into the Human Mind

6: Seeing

without knowing what they signify, whereas to us it is a
perfectly familiar language and therefore we take no notice
of the signs but attend only to the things they signify.

4. Colour is a quality of bodies, not a sensation in
the mind

Anyone who hasn’t been tutored by modern philosophy
understands ‘colour’ to be the name not of •a sensation
in the mind that can’t exist except when it is perceived but
rather •a quality or state of bodies that continues to be
the same whether or not it is seen. The scarlet rose that
is in front of me now remains a scarlet rose when I shut
my eyes, and was scarlet also at midnight when no eye
saw it. The colour remains when the appearance ceases; it
remains the same when the appearance changes. For when
I view this scarlet rose through a pair of green spectacles
the appearance is changed, but I don’t conclude that the
colour of the rose changed. To a person with jaundice it
has still another appearance; but he is easily convinced that
the change is in his eye and not in the colour of the object.
Every difference in the brightness of light makes the rose
have a different appearance, and total darkness takes away
all appearance, but it doesn’t make the least change in the
colour of the rose. Through various optical experiments we
can change the appearance of a body’s shape and size as
well of its colour; we can make one body appear to be ten.
But no-one thinks that a multiplying glass produces ten
guineas out of one, or that a microscope turns a guinea
into a ten-pound piece; and similarly no-one thinks that a
coloured glass changes •the real colour of the object seen
through it when it changes •the appearance of that colour.
The common language of mankind shows clearly that
we ought to distinguish •the colour of a body, which is

conceived to be a ﬁxed and permanent quality of it, from
•the appearance of that colour to the eye, which may be
varied a thousand ways depending on the light, the medium
or the eye itself. The body’s permanent colour is the cause
of all this variety of appearances, which it causes through
the mediation of various kinds and intensities of light and
of various transparent bodies in between. When a coloured
body is presented, there appears to the eye, or to the mind,
something that I have called ‘the appearance of colour’. Mr.
Locke calls it ‘an idea’, and there is nothing wrong with that.
This idea can’t exist except when it is perceived. It is a kind
of thought, and can only be an act of a perceiving or thinking
being. Our natural constitution leads us to think of this idea
as a sign of something external, and to be impatient until we
learn its meaning. A thousand experiments for this purpose
are made every day by children, even before they come to the
use of reason. They look at things, they handle them, they
put them in various orientations at different distances and in
different lights. The ideas of sight thus come to be associated
with, and readily to suggest, things that are external and
altogether unlike them. In particular, the idea that I have
called ‘the appearance of colour’ suggests the conception
of and belief in some unknown quality in the body, which
occasions the idea; and we give the name ‘colour’ to this
quality and not to the idea. Although the various colours
are in their nature equally unknown, we easily distinguish
them in our thought and talk by associating them with the
ideas they cause. In the same way such unknown qualities
as gravity, magnetism and electricity are distinguished by
their different effects. As we grow up, the mind becomes
accustomed to passing so rapidly from the ideas of sight to
the external things suggested by them that we don’t pay the
least attention to the ideas and don’t give them names in
common language.

54

Inquiry into the Human Mind

Thomas Reid

6: Seeing

When we think or speak of any particular colour, the
notion that is presented to the imagination may seem to
be perfectly simple, but it is really in a way compounded.
·That is, it seems not to have different parts, but it is really
complex or made up of constituent elements, because· it
involves •an unknown cause and •a known effect. The name
‘colour’—·like the more speciﬁc names ‘blue’, ‘yellow’ and so
on·—belongs only to the cause and not to the effect. But
because the cause is unknown, our only way of thinking
exclusively about it is by its relation to the known effect; so
the two go together in the imagination, so tightly linked that
they are mistaken for one simple object of thought. When I
want to think about the colours of bodies that we call ‘scarlet’
and ‘blue’, if I conceived them only as unknown qualities I
wouldn’t be able to perceive any distinction between them.
In order to keep them apart in my mind, therefore, I have
to link each of them, in my imagination, with •some effect
or some relation that it has and the other doesn’t; and the
most obvious candidate is •the appearance that it makes
to the eye. So it comes about that in the imagination the
appearance is so tightly linked with the quality called ‘a
scarlet colour’ that they are apt to be mistaken for one and
the same thing—different though they are in reality, one
being an idea in the mind and the other a quality of body.

I conclude, then, that colour is not a sensation but a
‘secondary quality’ of bodies, in the sense I have explained;
that it is a certain power in bodies which in full daylight
exhibits to the eye an appearance that is very familiar to
us although we have no name for it. Colour differs in one
way from other secondary qualities: whereas ·with them· the
name of the quality is sometimes given to the sensation that
indicates it and is occasioned by it, we seem never to give
the name of colour to the sensation but only to the quality.
This may be because the appearances of the same colour

are so various and changeable, depending on details of the
light, the medium and the eye, that language couldn’t afford
names for them. And indeed they are of so little interest
that they are never attended to, but serve only as signs to
introduce the things signiﬁed by them. It shouldn’t seem
incredible that such frequent and familiar appearances have
no names and are ·usually· not thought about; because I
have already shown that the same is true of many sensations
of touch, which are just as frequent and familiar.

5. An inference from the foregoing

From what I have said about colour we can infer two things,
·to which I shall devote a section each·. The ﬁrst is that one
of the most remarkable paradoxes of modern philosophy,
which has been universally admired as a great discovery,
turns out when thoroughly examined to be nothing but a
misuse of words. I mean the paradox that

colour isn’t a quality of bodies but only an idea in the
mind.

I have shown that the vulgar employ the word ‘colour’ to
signify not an idea in the mind but rather a permanent
quality of body. I have shown that there is really a permanent
quality of body to which the common use of this word exactly
agrees. Could you want a stronger proof that this quality is
the one the vulgar call ‘colour’? If you say ‘This quality that
you call “colour” is unknown to the vulgar, who therefore
can’t have any name for it’, I reply:

The quality is indeed known ·to the vulgar · only by
its effects, i.e. by its causing a certain idea in us;
but aren’t there countless qualities of bodies that are
known only by their effects, and which we neverthe-
less ﬁnd it necessary to have names for? Medicine
alone could provide us with a hundred examples;

55

Inquiry into the Human Mind

Thomas Reid

6: Seeing

don’t the words ‘astringent’, ‘narcotic’, ‘epispastic’ [=
‘blister-producing’], ‘caustic’ and endless others signify
qualities of bodies that are known only by their effects
on animal bodies? So why shouldn’t the vulgar have
a name for a quality whose effects are every moment
perceived by their eyes?

So we have all the reason that the nature of the thing admits,
to think that the vulgar apply the name ‘colour’ to the quality
of bodies that causes in us what the philosophers call the
‘idea of colour’. That there is such a quality in bodies is
agreed to by all philosophers who think there is any such
thing as body. Philosophers have thought ﬁt to

•leave nameless the quality of bodies that the vulgar
call ‘colour’, and to •give the name ‘colour’ to an idea
or appearance that the vulgar leave nameless

because they never think about it or reﬂect on it. So it seems
that when philosophers say that

colour is not in bodies, but in the mind,

and the vulgar say that

colour is not in the mind, but is a quality of bodies,

there is no difference between them about •things but only
·Even in a purely verbal
about •the meaning of a word.
disagreement, there can be a right side and a wrong, and
in this case the philosophers are wrong·.The vulgar have an
undoubted right to give names to things that they deal with
daily, and it seems fair to accuse philosophers of misusing
language when they change the meaning of a common word
without giving warning ·that they are doing so·.

If it is a good rule—·as Berkeley said it is·—to ‘think with
philosophers and speak with the vulgar’, it must be right to
speak with the vulgar when we also think with them, and
not to shock them by philosophical paradoxes which, when
put into common language, express only the common sense
of mankind.

If you ask a man who is not a philosopher ‘What is colour?’
or ‘What makes one body appear white and another scarlet?’
he can’t tell. He leaves that inquiry to philosophers, and
can embrace any hypothesis about it except the view of our
modern philosophers who assert that colour is not in bodies
but only in the mind.

Nothing strikes him as more shocking than that visible
objects should have no colour, and that colour should be in
something he thinks of as invisible! Yet this strange paradox
is not only accepted by everyone but is considered as one of
the ﬁnest discoveries of modern philosophy. The ingenious
Addison, in the Spectator no. 413, says this about it:

I have been assuming that my reader is acquainted
with that great modern discovery, now universally
accepted by all the inquirers into natural philosophy,
namely, that light and colours as grasped by the imag-
ination are only ideas in the mind and not qualities
existing in matter. This is a truth that has been proved
incontestably by many modern philosophers, and is
indeed one of the ﬁnest theoretical achievements of
that discipline. If the English reader wants to see this
line of thought explained in detail, he could consult
Locke’s Essay on the Human Understanding Book II
chapter 8.

Mr. Locke and Mr. Addison are writers who have deserved so
well of mankind that one must feel uncomfortable disagreeing
with them, and I wouldn’t want to do less than justice to a
‘discovery’ that they value so highly. And indeed it is only fair
to admit that Locke and other modern philosophers writing
about secondary qualities have the merit of distinguishing
more accurately than their predecessors did between •the
sensation in the mind and •the constitution or quality of
bodies that gives rise to the sensation. They have shown
clearly that these two things are not only distinct ·from one

56

Inquiry into the Human Mind

Thomas Reid

6: Seeing

another· but altogether unalike; that there is no resemblance
between the efﬂuvia of an odorous body and the sensation of
smell, or between the vibrations of a noise-making body and
the sensation of sound; that there can be no resemblance
between the feeling of heat and the constitution of the heated
body that gives rise to it, or between the appearance a
coloured body makes to the eye and the texture of the body
that causes it.

It was a considerable achievement to distinguish these
things accurately from one another; because, however dif-
ferent and unalike they are in their nature, they have been
always so associated in the imagination as to coalesce (as
it were) into one two-faced form whose dubiously double
nature meant that it couldn’t rightly be assigned either to
body or mind; and neither body nor mind could be given due
credit for this ‘two-faced form’ until it was properly sorted
out into its different constituent parts. None of the ancient
philosophers had made this distinction. The followers of
Democritus and Epicurus thought the forms of heat and
sound and colour to be in the mind only, but thought that
our senses falsely represented them as being in bodies. The
Aristotelians imagined that heat etc. are really in bodies,
and that likenesses of them are conveyed to the mind by our
senses.

One of these systems made the senses naturally false and
deceitful; the other made the qualities of body resemble the
sensations of the mind. To ﬁnd a third system—·an alterna-
tive to both of these·—the distinction I have mentioned had
to be made; and making it did avoid the errors of both those
ancient systems, freeing us from the hard fate of having to
believe either (·with the Aristotelians·) that our sensations
are like the qualities of bodies or (·with Democritus·) that
God has given us one faculty to deceive us and another to
detect the deceit!

So it is a pleasure to do justice to the doctrine of Locke
and other modern philosophers regarding colour and other
secondary qualities, giving it the credit that is due; but I beg
leave to criticize the language in which they have expressed
their doctrine. When they had explained and established the
distinction between •the appearance that colour makes to
the eye and •the state of the coloured body which (by the
laws of nature) causes that appearance, the question was
whether to give the name ‘colour’ to •the cause or to •the
effect. By giving it to the effect, as they have done, they have
set philosophy apparently in opposition to common sense
and exposed it to the ridicule of the vulgar. If only they had
given the name ‘colour’ to the cause, as they ought to have
done, they would then have had to join the vulgar in afﬁrming
that colour is a quality of bodies, and that there is no colour
or anything like colour in the mind. Their language as well
as their opinions would then have been perfectly agreeable
to the ordinary thoughts of mankind, and true philosophy
would have joined hands with common sense. Locke was no
enemy to common sense, however; so we must presume that
in this instance as in some others he was seduced by some
generally accepted hypothesis; and in my next section I shall
show that this was indeed the case.

6. None of our sensations resemble any of the
qualities of bodies

Of the two inferences mentioned at the start of the preceding
section, the second is that although colour is really a quality
of body, it isn’t represented to the mind by an idea or
sensation that resembles it; on the contrary, it is suggested
by an idea that doesn’t resemble it even slightly. And this
applies not only to colour but to all the qualities of body that
I have examined.

57

Inquiry into the Human Mind

Thomas Reid

6: Seeing

It is worth noting that in the analysis I have so far given of
the operations of the ﬁve senses and of the qualities of bodies
discovered by them, there hasn’t been a single instance of
any sensation that resembles any quality of body, or of any
quality of body whose image or resemblance is conveyed to
the mind by means of the senses.

No phenomenon in nature is harder to explain than the
transactions that are carried on between the mind and the
external world; there is no phenomenon that philosophical
minds have been more eager to dig into and to resolve.
Everyone agrees that these transactions are carried on by
means of the senses, and that’s as much as the vulgar want
to know; but philosophers want more. They must have some
system, some hypothesis, that shows how our senses make
us acquainted with external things. All the fertility of human
invention seems to have produced only one hypothesis for
this purpose, which therefore has been universally accepted.
It is the theory that the mind, like a mirror, receives the
images [= ‘likenesses’] of things from outside it by means of
the senses, so that the role of the senses is to convey these
images into the mind.

These images of external things in the mind ·have been
variously named·. We may call them ‘sensible forms’ or
‘sensible species’ with the Aristotelians; or ‘ideas of sensation’
with Locke; or with later philosophers (·especially Hume·)
we may distinguish ‘sensations’, which are immediately
conveyed by the senses, from ‘ideas of sensation’, which
are faint copies of our sensations retained in the memory
and imagination; but these are only differences about words.
The hypothesis I have mentioned is common to all these
different systems.

This hypothesis implies—and is agreed to imply—that no
material thing or quality of material thing can be conceived
by us or made an object of thought until its image has been

conveyed to the mind by means of the senses. I shall examine
this in detail later, and at present I merely point out two
things that might be expected as the natural consequences
of it:

•For every quality and attribute of bodies that we know
or can conceive, there is a corresponding sensation
which is the image and resemblance of that quality.
•Sensations that don’t resemble bodies or any of their
qualities can’t give us any conception of a material
world or of anything belonging to such a world.

Now I have already considered extension, shape, solidity,
motion, hardness, roughness, as well as colour, heat and
cold, sound, taste, and smell.
I have tried to show, that
our nature and constitution lead us to conceive these as
qualities of bodies, as all mankind have always conceived
them to be. I have likewise examined very attentively the
various sensations we have by means of the ﬁve senses, and
I couldn’t ﬁnd among them a single image [still = ‘likeness’]
of body or of any of its qualities. So those images of body
and of its qualities that are ·allegedly· in the mind—where
did they come from? Let philosophers answer this question.
All I can say is that they don’t come through the senses! I
am sure that with proper attention and care I can know my
sensations, and can say with certainty what they do and
what they don’t resemble. I have examined them one by one,
comparing them with matter and its qualities, and I can’t
ﬁnd one that shows up as having a resembling feature.

Our sensations are not images of matter or of any of its
qualities—a truth as evident as that ought not to surrender
to a hypothesis such as the one we are now considering,
however ancient it may be or however universally accepted by
philosophers. And there can’t be any friendly reconciliation
between the two—·i.e. between the evident truth and the
time-honoured hypothesis·. To see that this is so, let us

58

reﬂect on the spirit of the ancient and modern philosophy
concerning sensation.

During the reign of the Aristotelian philosophy, our sen-
sations were not minutely or accurately examined. The
attention of philosophers as well as of the vulgar was turned
to the things signiﬁed by the sensations, with the result that
in consequence of the ancient hypothesis it was taken for
granted that all the sensations we have from external things
are their forms or images. And thus the ·evident· truth I have
mentioned surrendered entirely to the ·ancient· hypothesis
and was altogether suppressed by it.

Descartes gave a ﬁne example of turning our attention
inward and examining our sensations, and this example
has been very worthily followed by modern philosophers,
particularly by Malebranche, Locke, Berkeley, and Hume
[this is the ﬁrst occurrence of Hume’s name in Reid’s text]. The effect
of this scrutiny has been a gradual discovery of the truth
that I have been discussing, namely that the sensations of
our minds don’t resemble the qualities or attributes of a
non-sentient inert substance such as we conceive matter to
be. But this valuable and useful discovery, in its different
stages, has still been unhappily combined with the ‘ancient
hypothesis’, and this unpromising pairing of two opinions
that are so unfriendly and discordant in their natures has
given rise to the monsters of paradox and scepticism of which
the modern philosophy is all too fairly accused.

Locke saw clearly and proved conclusively that the sen-
sations we have by taste, smell and hearing, as well as
the sensations of colour, heat and cold, don’t resemble
anything in bodies; and in this he agrees with Descartes
and Malebranche. Joining this opinion with the ·ancient·
hypothesis, it follows necessarily that three of our ﬁve senses
are cut off from telling us anything about the material world,
as being altogether unﬁt for that task.

Smell and taste and sound, as well as colour and heat,
can have no more relation to bodies than anger and gratitude
do; and the former have no more right to be called qualities
(whether primary or secondary) of bodies than do the latter.
For it was natural and obvious to argue thus from that
hypothesis:

•If heat etc. are real qualities of bodies, the sensations
by which we perceive them must resemble those
qualities;
•These sensations do not resemble any qualities of
bodies;
•Therefore heat etc. are not real qualities of bodies.

We see then that Locke, having found that the ideas of
secondary qualities are don’t resemble any qualities of bodies,
was compelled by a hypothesis common to all philosophers—
·the ‘ancient hypothesis’·—to deny that they are real qualities
of body. It is harder to explain why after this he called them
‘secondary qualities’ (I gather that he invented this name
for them). Surely he didn’t mean that they were secondary
qualities of the mind; and I don’t see what could make it
even slightly right to call them secondary qualities of bodies
after concluding that they aren’t qualities of bodies at all. In
this he seems to have bowed down to common sense and to
have been led by her authority even when it went against
his hypothesis. The same supreme mistress of our opinions
that led this philosopher to call things ‘secondary qualities of
bodies’, when according to his own principles and reasonings
they weren’t qualities of bodies at all, has led not merely the
vulgar of all ages but also philosophers—even the disciples
of Locke—to believe them to be real qualities of bodies. She
has led them to conduct experiments concerning the nature
of colour, sound and heat, in bodies. If there had been no
such thing in bodies, this investigation would have been
fruitless, but in fact it has produced very noble and useful

59

Inquiry into the Human Mind

Thomas Reid

6: Seeing

discoveries that constitute a very considerable part of natural
philosophy. If then natural philosophy is not a dream, there
is something in bodies that we call ‘colour’, ‘heat’ and ‘sound’.
And if this is so, the hypothesis from which the contrary is
concluded must be false; for an argument that leads to a
false conclusion rebounds against its premise and directs
its forces backwards. If the qualities of bodies were known
to us only by sensations that resemble them, then colour
etc. couldn’t be qualities of bodies; but colour etc. are real
qualities of bodies; therefore the qualities of bodies are not
known only by means of sensations that resemble them.

Moving on now: what Locke had proved with regard to
the sensations that we have by smell, taste and hearing,
Bishop Berkeley proved just as conclusively with regard to
all our other sensations—namely that none of them can in
the least resemble the qualities of a lifeless and non-sentient
being such as matter is conceived to be. Mr. Hume has
conﬁrmed this by his authority and reasoning. This ·new·
opinion surely casts a very unfavourable light on the ancient
hypothesis; yet that hypothesis has still been retained and
been conjoined with the new opinion. And what a brood of
monsters this has produced!

The ﬁrstborn of this union, and perhaps the most harm-
less, was ·the thesis that· the secondary qualities of body
were mere sensations of the mind. Next comes Malebranche’s
notion of ‘seeing all things in the ideas of the divine mind’,
but I shall pass that by as it was a foreigner who never
became naturalized in this island. After that there was
Berkeley’s thesis that extension and shape and hardness
and motion are nothing but ideas of the mind; that the same
is true of land and sea and houses and our own bodies, as
well as those of our wives and children and friends; and that
there is nothing existing in nature but minds and ideas.

The offspring that followed are still more frightful; it is
surprising that anyone could be found who had the courage
to act as the midwife, bringing them through gestation and
ushering them into the world! •No causes or effects; •no
substances, material or spiritual; •no evident truth even in
mathematical demonstration; •no liberty or active power;
•nothing existing in nature except impressions and ideas
following each other, without time, place, or subject. Surely
no age ever produced such a system of opinions, soundly
deduced—with great acuteness, clarity and elegance—from
a universally accepted principle. The ·ancient· hypothesis
that I have mentioned is the father of them all. The thesis
that our sensations and feelings are unlike external things
is the innocent mother of most of them.

It happens sometimes in an arithmetical calculation that
two errors balance one another, so that they have little or no
effect on the conclusion; but when one of them is corrected
and the other left uncorrected, we are led further from the
truth than by both together; and that seems to have been
what happened in the Aristotelian philosophy of sensation
when it was related to the modern. The Aristotelians adopted
two errors; but the second served as a corrective to the
ﬁrst, making it mild and gentle, so that their system didn’t
tend to lead to scepticism. The moderns have retained the
ﬁrst of those two errors, but have gradually detected and
corrected the second. The consequence has been that the
light we have kindled has created darkness, and scepticism
has advanced hand in hand with knowledge, spreading its
gloom ﬁrst over the material world and eventually over the
whole face of nature. Such a phenomenon as this is likely
to astonish even the lovers of light and knowledge while its
cause is unknown; but when the cause is detected, it may
give us hope that this darkness won’t last for ever but will
be followed by a more permanent light.

7. Visible shape and extension

Although there is no resemblance and (as far as we know) no
necessary connection between the quality in a body that we
call its ‘colour’ and the appearance that this colour makes to
the eye, it is quite otherwise with regard to its shape and size.
There is certainly a resemblance and a necessary connection
between the visible shape and size of a body and its real
shape and size. [See the note on ‘visible’ on page 49.] No-one can
explain why a scarlet colour affects the eye in the way it does;
no-one can be sure that it affects his eye in the same way as
it affects someone else’s, giving it the same appearance to
him as it has to the other person; but we can explain why a
circle placed obliquely to the eye appears in the form of an
ellipse. The visible shape, size and orientation can be worked
out by mathematical reasoning from the real shape, size and
orientation; and it can be demonstrated that every eye that
sees clearly and perfectly must in the same situation see
it in the form of an ellipse and not in any other. Indeed, I
venture to say that a man born blind, if he were instructed
in mathematics, would be able to work out the visible shape
of a body when he was told its real shape, distance and
orientation. Dr. Saunderson understood the projection of
the sphere, and he understood perspective. Well, for a blind
man to be able to determine the visible shape of a body all he
needs is to be able to project the outline of the body onto the
surface of a hollow sphere whose centre is in the eye. This
projection is the visible shape he wants, for it is the same
shape as the one projected on the retina in vision.

A blind man can conceive lines drawn from every point
on the object to the centre of the eye, making angles. He
can conceive that the length of the object will appear greater
or less in proportion to the angle that it makes at the eye;
and that the breadth—and in general the distance of any one

61

point on the object from any other point—will appear greater
or less in proportion to the angles that those distances make
at the eye. He can easily be made to conceive that the visible
appearance has no thickness, any more than a projection of
a sphere does, or a drawing in perspective. We could tell him
that until the eye is aided by experience it doesn’t represent
one object as nearer or more remote than another. Indeed he
would probably guess this on his own account, and tend to
think that the rays of light must make the same impression
on the eye, whatever distance they come from.

These are all the principles that we suppose our blind
mathematician to have; and he can certainly acquire them
all by information and reﬂection. If he is told the •real shape
and size of a body, and its orientation and distance in relation
to the eye, he can certainly, by means of these principles,
ﬁnd out its •visible shape and size. Using these principles he
can demonstrate that the visible shape of any body will be
the same as that of its projection on the surface of a hollow
sphere with the eye at its centre. And he can demonstrate
that a body’s visible size will be greater or less depending on
whether its projection occupies more or less of the surface of
this sphere.

For another way of looking at this matter, let us distin-
guish the position [Reid’s word] of objects in relation to the eye
from their distance from it. Objects that lie on the same
straight line drawn from the centre of the eye have the same
position, however different their distances from the eye may
be; but objects that lie on different straight lines drawn from
the eye’s centre have different positions; and this difference
of position is proportionate to the size of the angle made at
the eye by the straight lines in question. Having thus deﬁned
what we mean by the position of objects in relation to the eye,
it is obvious that just as

Inquiry into the Human Mind

Thomas Reid

6: Seeing

a body’s real shape consists in the situation of its
parts in relation to one another,

so also

a body’s visible shape consists in the position of its
several parts in relation to the eye;

from which it follows that just as

someone who has a distinct conception of the situation
of the parts of a body in relation to one another must
have a distinct conception of its real shape,

so also

•someone who conceives distinctly the position of a
body’s parts in relation to the eye must have a distinct
conception of its visible shape.

Now, there is surely nothing to prevent a blind man from
conceiving the position of a body’s parts in relation to the eye,
any more than from conceiving their situation in relation to
one another; so I conclude that a blind man can attain a
distinct conception of the visible shape of bodies.

Although I think the above arguments are sufﬁcient to
prove that a blind man can conceive the visible extension and
shape of bodies, I am still concerned to remove prejudices
against this truth. For this purpose it will be useful to com-
pare •the notion of visible shape that a blind mathematician
might give himself with •that which is presented to the eye
in vision, and to note ·three· differences.

(1) Visible shape is always presented to the eye in combi-
nation with colour. There is no intrinsic connection between
shape and colour, but because they have so invariably kept
company together we are hardly able to disconnect them
even in our imagination. What makes this especially hard to
do is the fact that we have never been accustomed to make
visible shape an object of our thought. We use it only as a
sign, and when it has served this purpose it passes away

62

without leaving a trace behind. The draughtsman or designer
whose business it is to hunt this fugitive form and to make
a copy of it ﬁnds how hard it is to do this even after many
years labour and practice. How good it is for him if at last he
can acquire the skill of making it hold still in his imagination
while he draws it! For then it is evident that he must be able
to draw as accurately from the life as from a copy [meaning,
presumably, ‘from the real object as from a drawing of it’]. But how
few of the professed masters of designing are ever able to
arrive at this degree of perfection! So it is no wonder that
we ﬁnd it so hard to •conceive shape apart from its constant
associate ·colour·, when it is so difﬁcult to •conceive it at
all. But our blind man’s notion of visible shape won’t be
associated with colour, of which he has no conception; but it
may be associated with hardness or smoothness, with which
he is acquainted by touch. These different associations that
things have are apt to deceive us into making the things
themselves seem different though in reality they are the
same.

(2) [Up to here, ‘shape’ has replaced Reid’s word ‘ﬁgure’ when that
is clearly what it means. In some of what follows, ‘ﬁgure’ sounds better
to our ears than ‘shape’, and will therefore be left untouched; but in
these contexts too Reid’s subject is indeed shape.] Secondly, the
blind man forms the notion of visible shape by thought and
by mathematical reasoning from principles, whereas the
sighted man has it instantaneously presented to his eye by
a kind of inspiration, without working at it or reasoning his
way towards it. ·Consider these two people, whom we can
suppose to have eyesight·. One of them

(a) forms the notion of a parabola or a cycloid from
the mathematical deﬁnition of those ﬁgures, without
ever having seen them drawn;

while the other

Inquiry into the Human Mind

Thomas Reid

6: Seeing

(b) doesn’t know the mathematical deﬁnitions of those
ﬁgures but sees them drawn on paper, or feels them
cut out in wood.

Each has a clear conception of the ﬁgures, (a) through
mathematical reasoning and (b) through his senses. Now,
the blind man forms his notions of visible ﬁgures in the
same way as (a) formed his notion of a parabola or a cycloid
without ever having seen one.

(3) Visible shape leads a sighted man directly to the
conception of the real shape of which it is a sign. But the
blind man’s thoughts move in the opposite direction: he
must ﬁrst know the real shape, distance and situation of the
body, and from that he slowly traces out the visible shape by
mathematical reasoning. And his nature doesn’t lead him to
conceive this visible shape as a sign; it is—·and he knows it
is·—a creature of his own reason and imagination.

8. Answers to some questions about visible shape

‘What kind of thing is this visible ﬁgure? Is it a sensation, or
an idea? If it is an idea, from what sensation is it copied?’
These questions may seem trivial or irrelevant to someone
who doesn’t know that certain modern philosophers have set
up a tribunal of inquisition to which everything in nature
must answer! The questions the tribunal asks are few indeed,
but very dreadful in their consequences. They are only these:
Is the prisoner ·in the dock· an impression or an idea?
If he is an idea, from what impression was he copied?
If it turns out that the prisoner is neither an impression nor
an idea copied from some impression, he is immediately—
without being allowed to offer any plea that might restrain
the judgment—sentenced to pass out of existence and to be
for ever afterwards an empty meaningless sound or the ghost

of a departed entity.

This dreadful tribunal has tried and condemned •cause
and effect, •time and place, •matter and spirit; so how can
such a poor ﬂimsy form as •visible shape stand before it?
It must even plead guilty, and confess that it is neither an
impression nor an idea. For, alas! it is notorious that visible
shape is extended in length and breadth; it may be long or
short, broad or narrow, triangular, quadrangular or circular;
so unless ideas and impressions are extended and shaped it
can’t be an idea or impression.

‘Well, then, to what category of beings does visible shape
belong?’
I can only answer by presenting some pointers
which may enable visible shaped to be ·metaphysically·
placed by people who are better acquainted with the cat-
egories than I am.
•It is, as I have said, the position of
the different parts of a shaped body in relation to the eye.
•The different positions of the parts of the body in relation
to the eye, when put together, make a real shape that is
truly extended in length and breadth (·two dimensions·) and
that represents a shape that is extended in length, breadth
and thickness (·three dimensions·). •Similarly, a projection
of the sphere is a real ﬁgure that has length and breadth
but represents the sphere, which has three dimensions. •A
projection of the sphere, or a perspectival view of a palace,
is a ‘representative’ in the very same sense as visible shape
is, and wherever they have their lodgings in the categories
visible shape will be found to live next door to them.

‘Is there any sensation that is speciﬁcally associated with
visible shape—one that suggests it in vision? By what means
is visible shape presented to the mind?’ This is a question of
some importance if we are to get a clear notion of the faculty
of seeing. To throw as much light on it as I can, I shall have
to compare this sense with other senses, and to make certain
suppositions which may enable us to distinguish things that

63

Inquiry into the Human Mind

Thomas Reid

6: Seeing

are apt to be confused with one another although they are
totally different.

Three of our senses give us information about things at
a distance: •smell, •hearing and •sight.
In smelling and
hearing we have a sensation or impression on the mind, a
sensation which our constitution makes us take to be a sign
of something external; but the sensation is not accompanied
by any information about the position of this external thing
in relation to the organ of sense. When I •hear the sound of
a coach, I can’t tell whether the sounding body is above or
below, on my right or on my left, unless I have had ·relevant·
previous experience. In short: the sensation suggests to me
some external object as its cause or occasion; but doesn’t
suggest anything about the position of the object, whether it
lies in this direction or in that. The same holds for •smelling.
But the case is quite different for seeing. When I •see an
object, the appearance made by its colour may be called
the sensation that suggests to me some external thing as
its cause; and it also suggests the individual direction and
position of this cause in relation to the eye.
I know it is
precisely in such-and-such a direction and in no other. At
the same time, I am not conscious of anything that can be
called ‘sensation’ except the sensation of colour. The position
of the coloured thing is not a sensation, but by the laws of
my constitution it is presented to the mind along with the
colour, without any additional sensation.

Suppose that the ·human· eye were so constituted that
the rays coming from any one point on the object were
diffused over the whole retina rather than being, as they
are in fact, collected at one point on the retina. Those who
understand the structure of the eye will see that in that
case the eye would show the colour of a body as our eyes do
but that it wouldn’t show either shape or orientation. The
operation of that kind of eye would be exactly like that of

hearing and smell, giving no perception of shape or extension
but merely of colour. This supposition is in fact not entirely
imaginary; for it nearly ﬁts the situation of most people who
have cataracts. In them the crystalline lens lets rays of light
through but diffuses them over the retina, so that the person
with a cataract sees things as one does through a glass of
broken jelly—they perceive the colour of objects but not their
shape or size.

Second supposition: suppose that smell and sound were
conveyed in straight lines from the objects, and that every
sensation of hearing and smell suggested the precise direc-
tion or position of its object.
In that case the operations
of hearing and smelling would be similar to that of seeing;
we would smell and hear the shape of objects in the same
sense as now we see it; and every smell and sound would
be associated with some shape in the imagination, just as
colour is in fact.

We have reason to believe that light-rays make some
impression on the retina, but we aren’t conscious of this im-
pression and the anatomists and philosophers haven’t been
able to discover what it is or what its effects are—whether it
produces •a vibration in the nerve, or •the motion of some
subtle ﬂuid contained in the nerve, or •something else again
to which we can’t give a name. Whatever it is, I shall call it
the ‘material impression’, being careful to remember that it
an impression on body, not on the mind, and that it isn’t
a sensation and can’t be like any sensation. . . . Now when
this material impression is made on a particular point on
our retina, by the laws of our constitution it suggests two
things to the mind—the colour and the position of some
external object. No-one can give a reason why that same
material impression couldn’t have suggested sound or smell
(or both) along with the object’s position. Why does it in
fact suggest colour and position and nothing else? We can

64

Inquiry into the Human Mind

Thomas Reid

6: Seeing

answer this only by saying ‘That’s how we are made’ or
‘That’s how God wanted it to operate’. And since there is no
necessary connection between these two things suggested by
this material impression (·colour and position·), our Creator
could have suggested one of them without the other if he had
wanted to. Let us then make a third supposition: since it
plainly appears to be possible, suppose that our eyes had
been constructed in such a way that they suggested to us the
position of the object, without suggesting its colour or any
other quality. A consequence of this supposition, obviously,
is that the person who had such an eye would perceive
the visible ﬁgure of bodies without having any sensation
or impression made on his mind. The ﬁgure he perceives
is altogether external, so it would be a gross misuse of
language to call it an impression ‘on the mind’. If you say
‘It is impossible to perceive a ﬁgure unless there is some
impression of it on the mind’ I beg leave not to admit the
impossibility of this without some proof; and I can’t ﬁnd any.
Nor can I conceive what is meant by ‘impression of ﬁgure on
the mind’. I can conceive an impression of ﬁgure on wax,
or on any body that is ﬁt to receive it; but an impression of
it ‘on the mind’ is to me quite unintelligible; and although
I form the clearest conception of the ﬁgure, I can’t ﬁnd any
impression of it on my mind, however hard I look.

If, ﬁnally, we suppose that the eye regains its power of
perceiving colour, I think you’ll agree that now it perceives
shape in the very same way as before, the only difference
being that now colour is always joined with it.

In answer to the proposed question, therefore: there
seems to be no sensation that is special to visible shape
or whose job it is to suggest it. Visible shape seems to be
suggested immediately by the material impression—of which
we are not conscious—on the eye. And why can’t a material
impression on the •retina suggest •visible shape, as well as

the material impression made on the •hand when we grasp a
ball suggests •real shape? In the one case, one and the same
material impression suggests both colour and visible shape;
and in the other case, one and the same material impression
suggests hardness, heat, or cold, and real shape, all at the
same time.

‘Given that the •visible shape of bodies is a real and
external object to the eye, as their •tangible shape is to the
touch, why is it so hard to attend to •the former and so easy
to attend to •the latter?’ This is the ﬁnal question to be asked
and answered in this section, ·and it is a good question, with
a lot of bite·. It is certainly true that

•visible shape is presented to the eye more often than
tangible shape is to the touch,
•visible shape is as distinct and determinate an object
as tangible shape, and
•visible shape seems in its own nature to be as proper
a topic for theory as tangible shape.

Yet visible shape been attended to so little that it never had
a name in any language until Bishop Berkeley gave it the
name that I am using, following him, to distinguish it from
the shape that is the object of touch.

The difﬁculty of attending to the visible shape of bodies
and making it an object of thought seems to be similar to the
difﬁculty we encounter in attending to our sensations—so
similar that they probably have similar causes. Nature
intended the visible shape as a sign of the tangible shape
and situation of bodies, and has taught us by a kind of
instinct to put it always to this use. And so the mind skims
across it rapidly, to attend to the things signiﬁed by it. For
the mind to stop at the visible shape and attend to it would
be as unnatural as it would be for a spherical body to stop
on slope. There is an inner force that constantly carries it
forward and can’t be overcome except by a contrary force.

65

Inquiry into the Human Mind

Thomas Reid

6: Seeing

There are other external things that nature intended as
the mind
signs, and we ﬁnd they have this in common:
is inclined to overlook them and to attend only to the things
they signify. For example, certain states of the human
face are natural signs of the person’s present state of mind.
Everyone understands the meaning of these signs, but not
one person in a hundred ever attends to the signs themselves
or knows anything about them. So you may ﬁnd many an
excellent practical face-reader who knows nothing about
the proportions of a face and can’t draw or describe the
expression of any one emotion.

An excellent painter or sculptor can tell not only what the
proportions are of a good face but what changes each passion
makes in it. This, however, is one of the chief mysteries of
his art, and it can’t be acquired without inﬁnite labour and
attention as well as the right kind of intellect. But when he
puts his art into practice and captures a passion by its proper
signs, no-one needs skill or deep thought to understand the
meaning of these signs.

What I have said about painting might easily be applied
to all the ﬁne arts. In each of them the difﬁculty consists
in knowing and attending to natural signs whose meaning
every man understands.

We pass easily and by a natural impulse from the sign to
the thing signiﬁed, whereas it is hard and difﬁcult work to go
backwards from the thing signiﬁed to the sign. So because
visible shape is intended by nature to be a sign we pass on
immediately to the thing signiﬁed, and can’t easily return to
attend to the sign.

Nothing shows more clearly our tendency to ignore visible
shape and visible extension than the fact that they have
entirely escaped the notice of mathematicians, although
mathematical reasoning is just as applicable to them as
it is to tangible shape and extension. The shape and ex-

tension that are objects of touch have been tortured ten
thousand ways for twenty centuries, and a very noble system
of science—·namely geometry·—has been drawn out of them,
whereas not a single ·mathematical· proposition do we ﬁnd
concerning the shape and extension that are the immediate
objects of sight.

When a geometrician draws a diagram with the most
perfect accuracy, and keeps his eye ﬁxed on it while he goes
through a long process of reasoning and demonstrates the
relations of the different parts of his ﬁgure, it doesn’t occur
to him that the •visible ﬁgure presented to his eye is only
the representative of a •tangible ﬁgure which is what he is
really attending to; it doesn’t occur to him that these two
ﬁgures have really different properties, and that what he
demonstrates to be true of the one is not true of the other.

seem so

This may

great a paradox—even to
mathematicians!—that it won’t be believed until it has been
demonstrated. Well, it’s not hard to demonstrate, if you
will have the patience to enter just a little way into the
mathematical consideration of visible shape, which I shall
call ‘the geometry of visibles’.

9. The geometry of visibles

In this geometry, the deﬁnitions of ‘point’, of ‘line’ (whether
straight or curved), of ‘angle’ (whether acute, or right, or
obtuse), and of ‘circle’ are the same as in common geometry.
The mathematical reader will easily enter into the whole
mystery of this geometry if he attends properly to these
·eight· evident principles.

1. Suppose an eye placed at the centre of a sphere,
·looking outwards·. Every great circle on the sphere will
have the same appearance to the eye as if it were a straight
line. This is because the eye won’t perceive the curvature

66

Inquiry into the Human Mind

6: Seeing

of the circle because the curve is always turned directly
towards the eye. For the same reason, any line that is drawn
in the plane of a circumference of the sphere will appear
straight to the eye, whether or not it is really so.

2. Every visible straight line will appear to coincide with
some great circle of the sphere; and the circumference of
that great circle, even when it is extended until it returns
into itself, will appear to be a continuation of the same visible
straight line. . . . Here is why.

The eye perceives only the positions of objects in
relation to itself, and not their distances. So any
two points that have the same position in relation to
the eye, no matter how different their distances from
it may be, will be seen by the eye in a single visible
place. Now, since a plane passing through the eye
and a given visible straight line, will be the plane of
some great circle of the sphere, every point on the
visible straight line will have the same position as
some point on the great circle; therefore, they will
both have the same visible place, and coincide to the
eye; and the whole circumference of the great circle
continued even until it returns into itself will appear
to be a continuation of the same visible straight line.

Hence it follows:

3. That every visible straight line when it is continued in
directum as far as it can be continued, will be represented by
a great circle of a sphere in whose centre the eye is placed.
It follows,

4. That the visible angle made by two intersecting visible
straight lines is equal to the spherical angle made by the in-
tersection of the two great circles that are the representatives
of these visible lines. For since the visible lines appear to
coincide with the great circles, the visible angle made by the
former must be equal to the visible angle made by the latter.

67

But the visible angle made by the two great circles when
seen from the centre is the same size as the spherical angle
that they really make, as mathematicians know; therefore
the visible angle made by any two visible lines is equal to the
spherical angle made by the two great circles of the sphere
that are their representatives.

5.

It follows obviously that every visible straight-lined
triangle will coincide in all its parts with some spherical
triangle. The sides of either will appear equal to the sides of
the other, and the angles of either to the angles of the other;
and therefore the whole of one triangle will appear equal to
the whole of the other. In short: to the eye they will be one
and the same, and have the same mathematical properties.
Thus, the properties of visible straight-lined triangles are not
the same as the properties of plane triangles, but are the
same as those of spherical triangles.

6. Every lesser circle of the sphere will appear a circle to
the eye (which we are still supposing to be at the centre of
the sphere). And conversely every visible circle will appear to
coincide with some lesser circle of the sphere.

7. Moreover, the whole surface of the sphere will repre-
sent the whole of visible space: every visible point coincides
with—and has the same visible place as—some point on
the surface of the sphere, so the totality of the parts of the
spherical surface will represent the totality of possible visible
places, i.e. the whole of visible space. And from this it follows,
in the last place,

8. That every visible ﬁgure will be represented by that part
of the surface of the sphere on which it could be projected,
the eye being in the centre. And every such visible ﬁgure will
bear the same ratio to the whole of visible space as the part
of the spherical surface that represents it bears to the whole
spherical surface.

The mathematical reader, I hope, will ﬁnd it quite easy to
take in these principles and will just as easily perceive that
the following propositions about visible ﬁgure and space—
which I offer only as a specimen—can be mathematically
derived from them, and are as true and obvious as Euclid’s
propositions concerning tangible shapes.

1. Every straight line when continued long enough

eventually returns into itself.

2. A straight line returning into itself is the longest
possible straight line; and all other straight lines bear
a ﬁnite ratio to it.

3. A straight line returning into itself, divides the whole
of visible space into two equal parts, each of which
will be surrounded by this straight line.

4. The whole of visible space bears a ﬁnite ratio to any

part of it.

5. Any two straight lines when they are continued for
long enough will meet at two points, and mutually
bisect each other.

6. If two lines are parallel—i.e. everywhere equally distant

from each other—they can’t both be straight.

7. Given any straight line, a point can be found that is at

the same distance from all the points on it.

8. A circle can be parallel to a straight line, i.e. can be

equally distant from it in all its parts.

9. Straight-lined triangles whose angles match also

match in the lengths of their sides.

10. Of every straight-lined triangle, the three angles

taken together are greater than two right angles.

11. The angles of a straight-lined triangle may all be right

angles, or all obtuse angles.

12. The difference in the areas of two unequal circles is
not proportional to the difference between the squares
of their diameters, and the difference in their circum-

ferences is not proportional to the difference between
their diameters.

This small specimen of the geometry of visibles is intended
to lead you to a clear and distinct conception of the shape
and extension that is presented to the mind by vision; and
to demonstrate the truth of my earlier statement •that the
shapes and the extension that are the immediate objects
of sight are not the shapes and the extension that common
geometry deals with; •that when the geometrician looks at his
diagram while demonstrating a proposition, he has a shape
presented to his eye that is only a sign and representative
of a tangible shape; •that he entirely neglects the visible
shape and attends only to the tangible one; and •that
these two shapes have different properties, so that what
he demonstrates of the one is not true of the other.

Still, it should be noted •that a small part of a spherical
surface doesn’t perceptibly differ from a plane surface, so
that a small part of visible extension differs very little from
the extension in length and breadth that is the object of
touch. And •that the human eye is so formed that an object
that is seen distinctly and at one view can occupy only a
small part of visible space. That is because we never see
clearly anything that is at a considerable distance from the
axis of the eye, so that if we want to see a large object at
one view we must place our eye so far away from it that it
occupies only a small part of visible space. From these two
observations it follows that plane shapes seen at one view,
when their planes are not oblique but direct to the eye, differ
little from the visible shapes that they present to the eye. The
various lines in the tangible shape have very nearly the same
proportions to each other as ·do the corresponding lines·
in the visible shape; and the angles of one are very nearly
(though not strictly and mathematically) equal to those of
the other. So, although we have found many instances of

68

Inquiry into the Human Mind

Thomas Reid

6: Seeing

natural signs that don’t in the least resemble the things
signiﬁed, this isn’t the case with regard to visible shape. It
always resembles the thing signiﬁed by it in the way a plan or
proﬁle has to what it represents; and in some cases the sign
and thing signiﬁed—·i.e. the visible ﬁgure and the tangible
ﬁgure·— have the same shape and the same proportions, so
far as our senses can detect.

If we could ﬁnd a being who was equipped with sight
but with no other external senses, and who was capable of
reﬂecting and reasoning on what he saw, his notions and
philosophical speculations might help us in the difﬁcult task
of distinguishing •the perceptions we have purely by sight
from •the ones that come from other senses. Let us suppose
such a being, and get the best understanding we can of what
notion he would have of visible objects, and what conclusions
he would deduce from them. We mustn’t think of him as
disposed by his constitution, as we are, to regard the visible
appearance as a sign of something else; to him it isn’t a sign
because ·for him· there is nothing signiﬁed by it; so we must
suppose him as much disposed to attend to the visible shape
and extension of bodies as we are disposed to attend to their
tangible shape and extension.

If various shapes were presented to his sense, then as
they became familiar he could of course compare them with
one another and perceive their likenesses and unlikenesses.
He could perceive visible objects to have length and breadth,
but he couldn’t have any notion of a third dimension, any
more than we can have a notion of a fourth. All visible
objects would appear to be terminated by lines, straight or
curved; and objects terminated by the same visible lines
would occupy the same place and ﬁll the same part of visible
space. He couldn’t have the thought of one object’s being
behind another, or nearer or more distant than another.

To us, with our notion of three dimensions, a line can be
conceived as straight, or as curved in one dimension and
straight in another; or as curved in two dimensions. Suppose
a line to be drawn upward and downward, its length makes
one dimension which I shall call ‘upward and downward’.
That leaves two other dimensions, in which it may be straight
or curved. It may be bent to the right or to the left; and if it
doesn’t bend either way, it is straight in this dimension. If
so, there still remains one other dimension, in which it may
be curved, for it may be bent backward or forward. When
we conceive a tangible straight line, we exclude curvature
in each of these two dimensions; what is conceived to be
excluded must be conceived, just as what is conceived to
be included must be conceived; so it follows that all the
three dimensions enter into our conception of a straight line.
Its length is one dimension; and the conception of it also
•includes its straightness in two other dimensions, which is
to say that it •excludes the line’s being curved in these two
dimensions.

The being we have supposed, having no conception of
more than two dimensions of which the length of a line is one,
can’t possibly conceive it either straight or curved in more
than one dimension; so that in his conception of a straight
line, curvature to the right or left is excluded but curvature
backward or forward can’t be excluded because he doesn’t
and can’t have any conception of such curvature. This shows
us why a line that is straight to the eye can return into itself:
its being straight to the eye only implies straightness in one
dimension, and a line that is straight in one dimension can
be curved in another dimension, and so can return into itself.
To us, who conceive three dimensions, a surface is what has
length and breadth, excluding thickness; and a surface can
be either plane or curved in this third dimension; so that
the notion of a third dimension enters into our conception

69

Inquiry into the Human Mind

Thomas Reid

6: Seeing

of a surface, for it is only by means of this third dimension,
that we can distinguish surfaces into plane and curved,
neither of which can be conceived without conceiving a third
dimension.

The being whom we have supposed has no conception
of a third dimension, so his visible ﬁgures have length and
breadth but his thought of them neither includes nor ex-
cludes thickness, because he has no conception of thickness.
It follows that visible ﬁgures, though they have length and
breadth as surfaces have, are neither plane surfaces nor
curved surfaces. For ‘curved surface’ implies curvature in a
third dimension, and ‘plane surface’ implies lack of curvature
in a third dimension; and our supposed being can’t conceive
either of these because he has no conception of a third
dimension. Moreover, although he has a distinct conception
of two lines intersecting to make an angle, he can’t have
the thought of a plane angle or of a spherical angle. Even
his notion of a point is somewhat less determined [here = ‘less
complex’] than ours. Our notion of a point excludes length,
breadth and thickness; his excludes length and breadth, but
it can’t either exclude or include thickness because he has
no conception of that.

Having thus settled the notions that such a being as we
have supposed might form of mathematical points, lines,
angles and shapes, it is easy to see that by comparing
these with one another and reasoning about them he could
discover their relations and arrive at geometrical conclusions
about them, built on self-evident principles. No doubt he
could also have the same notion of numbers as we have, and
construct a system of arithmetic.
It doesn’t matter what
order he might follow in such discoveries, or how much
time and trouble they might take; what matters is just to
know what such a being could discover, using reason and
ingenuity, with no sensory input except from sight.

It is harder to attend to an account of possibilities than
to a factual account—even one the truth of which is not
authenticated. So let me present an extract from the trav-
els of Johannes Rudolphus Anepigraphus, a Rosicrucian
philosopher who made a deep study of the occult sciences
from which he learned how to transport himself to various
parts of the earth and to converse with various orders of
intelligences ·that he found there·.
In the course of his
adventures he became acquainted with an order of beings
who are exactly such as I have supposed—·i.e. they have
eyesight but no other external senses·.

How they communicate their views to one another, and
how he came to know their language and become initiated
into their philosophy—as well as of many other details that
might have gratiﬁed the curiosity of his readers and perhaps
made him easier to believe—he hasn’t thought ﬁt to inform
us, because these are things that only insiders should know.
His account of their philosophy is as follows.

‘Many of the Idomenians are very intelligent and much
given to contemplation. They have most elaborate theories
of arithmetic, geometry, metaphysics and physics. In the
two latter, indeed, they have had many disputes that have
been carried on with great subtlety, and they are divided
into different sects; yet in arithmetic and geometry there
has been as much unanimity as there is among the human
species. Their principles relating to numbers and arithmetic
is exactly the same as ours except for differences of notation,
but their geometry differs very considerably from ours.’

As our author’s account of the geometry of the Idome-
nians agrees in everything with the geometry of visibles of
which I have given a specimen above, I shall pass over it. He
goes on thus:

‘Colour, extension, and shape are conceived to be the es-
sential properties of body. A very considerable sect maintains

70

Inquiry into the Human Mind

Thomas Reid

6: Seeing

that colour is the essence of body. They say:

If there had been no colour there would have been no
perception or sensation. Colour is all that we do or can
perceive that is exclusive to body, because extension
and shape are possessed by empty space as well as by
body. Consider what is involved in supposing a body
to be annihilated: colour is the only thing in it that
can be annihilated, for the place that it occupies—and
thus the shape and extension of that place—must stay
in existence, and can’t be imagined not to exist.

These philosophers hold that space is

the place of all bodies,
immovable and indestructible,
without shape,
exactly alike in all its parts,
incapable of growing or shrinking,
measurable; because each tiny part of space bears a
ﬁnite ratio to the whole.

So that with them the whole extent of space is the common
and natural measure for everything that has length and
breadth: the size of every body and of every ﬁgure is stated in
terms of what fraction it is of the whole universe. Similarly,
the common and natural measure of length is an inﬁnite
straight line, which (as I noted above) returns into itself, has
no limits, yet bears a ﬁnite ratio to every other line.

‘Their natural philosophy [here = ‘philosophy and natural sci-
ence’], as the wisest of them admit, has been for many ages
in a very low state. The philosophers, having observed that
one body can differ from another only in •colour, •shape or
•size, took it for granted that all the particular qualities of
bodies must arise from the various combinations of •these
their essential attributes. So it was thought that the aim
of natural philosophy should be to show how the various
combinations of these three qualities in different bodies

produced all the phenomena of nature. It would take for ever
to enumerate the various systems that were invented for this
purpose, and the disputes that continued for ages, with the
followers of each system using great skill to expose the weak
points in other systems and to disguise the weak points in
their own.

’Eventually some free-thinkers with a sense of humour,
tired of eternal disputation and of the labour of patching and
propping weak theories, began to complain about •nature’s
ﬁne-grained complexity, •the inﬁnite changes that bodies
undergo in shape, colour and size, and •the difﬁculty of
accounting for these appearances. They made this their
excuse for giving up, as empty and useless, all inquiries into
the causes of things.

‘These wits had plenty of raw materials for mirth and
ridicule in the systems of ·natural· philosophers, and, ﬁnding
it an easier task to pull down than to build up and support,
their view began to spread mightily, and went on with great
success. They were helped in this by the fact that each
sect provided them with weapons and soldiers with which
to destroy some other sect. Thus philosophy gave way to
scepticism and irony, and systems that had been the work of
ages and the admiration of the learned became jokes for the
vulgar; for even the vulgar were glad to join in the triumph
over a kind of learning of which they had long been suspi-
cious because all it produced was wrangling and quarrelling.
The wits having now acquired a great reputation, and ﬂushed
with success, began to think that to complete their triumph
they needed to overturn every claim to knowledge; so they
began their attacks on arithmetic, geometry, and even on
the common notions of uneducated Idomenians. Conquerors
have always found it hard to know where to stop!

‘In the meantime [this is still Anepigraphus speaking], natural
philosophy began to rise from its ashes under the direction of

71

Inquiry into the Human Mind

Thomas Reid

6: Seeing

a person of high intelligence who is regarded as having had
something in him above Idomenian nature. He remarked
that the Idomenian faculties were certainly intended to be
used for contemplation, and that •the works of nature were
a nobler subject to exercise them on than •the follies of
systems or •the errors of the learned; and, being aware of
the difﬁculty of ﬁnding out the causes of natural things, he
proposed to make accurate observations of the phenomena of
nature in order to ﬁnd out the rules according to which they
happen, without inquiring into the causes of those rules.

‘In this he made considerable progress himself, and
planned out much work for his followers, who call themselves
‘inductive philosophers’. The sceptics look with envy at this
rising sect, which they see as eclipsing their reputation and
threatening to limit their range of inﬂuence; but they can’t
decide what direction to attack it from. The vulgar begin to
reverence it, as producing useful discoveries.

‘Every Idomenian ﬁrmly believes that two or more bodies
can exist in the same place ·at the same time·. For their
sense—·their eyesight·—tells them this, and they can’t doubt
it any more than they can doubt whether they have any per-
ception at all. They often see two bodies meet and coincide in
the same place, and then separate again, without undergoing
any perceptible change as a result of this penetration ·of each
by the other·. When two bodies meet and occupy a single
place, usually only one of them appears in that place, while
the other disappears. The one that continues to appear is
said to “overcome”, the other to “be overcome”.’

To this quality of bodies they gave a name which our
author tells us has no translation in any human language. . . .
He calls it the ‘overcoming quality’ of bodies. He assures us
that:

The theorizing that went on concerning this one
quality of bodies, and the hypotheses devised to

explain it, were sufﬁcient to ﬁll many volumes. And
just as many hypotheses have been invented by the
Idomenian philosophers to explain the changes of
size and shape—qualities that they perceive to be
in continual ﬂux in most bodies that move. The
founder of the inductive sect, believing that Idome-
nian faculties weren’t capable of discovering the real
causes of these phenomena, worked on ﬁnding from
observation what laws they are connected by; and
he discovered many mathematical ratios and rela-
tions concerning the motions, sizes, shapes, and the
‘overcoming quality’ of bodies—relations conﬁrmed by
constant experience. But the opponents of this sect
prefer to content themselves with •ﬁctional causes
of these phenomena, rather than accepting the •real
laws that govern them—laws that humble their pride
by being admittedly not explainable in their turn.

Thus far Johannes Rudolphus Anepigraphus. . . . I shan’t
undertake to judge the narrative of this learned traveller by
the ‘external’ marks of his credibility; I shall conﬁne myself
to the marks that textual scholars call ‘internal’. . . . The
important question is whether the account given above is
a true report on their geometry and philosophy. We have
all the faculties they have along with others that they lack;
so we can form some judgment concerning their philosophy
and geometry by putting aside all our senses but one, and
reasoning purely on the basis of the perceptions we have
by sight. As far as I can judge in this way, after a careful
examination, their geometry must be such as Anepigraphus
has described. Nor does his account of their philosophy
·and science· appear to contain any obvious marks of fakery,
though here, no doubt, we should allow for liberties that
travellers take ·with the truth·, as well as for involuntary
mistakes that they are apt to make.

10. The parallel motion of the eyes

Having explained visible shape as clearly as I can, and shown
how it connects with the thing signiﬁed by it, I should next
consider certain phenomena of the eyes and of vision. They
are ones that have commonly been attributed to •custom, to
•anatomical causes, or to •mechanical causes; but I think
they come down to •basic powers and forces of the human
mind, which is why they belong properly to the subject of
this inquiry. ·They will be my topic until the end of section
19·.

The ﬁrst of these phenomena is the parallel motion of the
eyes: when one eye is turned to the right or left, upward or
downward, or straight ahead, the other always goes along
with it in the same direction. It is obvious to us when both
eyes are open that they are always turned the same way, as
if the two were acted on by a single moving force; and if one
eye is shut and a hand placed over it while the other turns
in various ways, we feel ·in the palm of the hand· the closed
eye turn at the same time—and it does this whether or not
we want it to. This phenomenon is surprising because all the
anatomists agree that the muscles that move the two eyes
and the nerves that serve these muscles are entirely distinct
and unconnected. If we saw a man who throughout his life
never moved one arm without moving the other precisely in
the same way, so that they were always parallel, we would
ﬁnd this very surprising and inexplicable. But it would be
no harder to ﬁnd the physical cause of such motion of the
arms than it is to ﬁnd the cause of the parallel motion of the
eyes, which is perfectly similar.

The only cause that anyone has proposed for this parallel
motion of the eyes is custom. The explanation goes like this:
We ﬁnd by experience, when we begin to look at
objects, that to get a clear view of something we need

to turn both eyes towards it; so we soon get the habit
of doing this every time and gradually lose the power
of doing otherwise.

This account of the matter seems inadequate, because habits
aren’t acquired at once; it takes time to acquire and to
conﬁrm them; and if this motion of the eyes came from habit
we would see newborn children turn their eyes different ways,
and move one without the other, as they do their hands or
legs. I know that some say that they are apt to do this; but I
have never found it true from my own observation, although
I have taken trouble to make observations relating to this
and have had good opportunities ·to do so·. [Reid was the father
of nine children.] I have also consulted experienced midwives,
mothers and nurses, and found them to agree that they had
never observed distortions of this kind in the eyes of children
except when they had reason to suspect that the child was
ill.

So it seems to be extremely probable that there is some-
thing in the ·human· constitution, some natural instinct
lying deeper than custom, which directs us to move both
eyes always the same way.

We don’t know how the mind acts on the body, nor by
what power the muscles are contracted and relaxed; but we
see that in some of our voluntary motions as well as in some
of the involuntary ones this power is directed in such a way
that many muscles that have no material tie or connection
act in concert, each being taught to play its part with correct
timing and rhythm. Think about how a company of expert
actors in a theatrical performance (or excellent musicians
in an orchestra or good dancers in a country dance) work
together so that their separate contributions produce one
uniform effect; well, they don’t do this in a more regular
and orderly way than a number of muscles do in many of
the animal functions and in many voluntary actions. Yet

73

Inquiry into the Human Mind

Thomas Reid

6: Seeing

we see such actions being performed just as skillfully and
regularly by children, and by people who don’t know that
they have such muscles, as by the most skillful anatomist
or physiologist.

Who taught all the muscles involved in sucking, swal-
lowing, breathing, excreting and so on to play their part in
such regular order and with the timing just right? It wasn’t
custom, surely. It was ·God·, the powerful and wise being
who made the human body and ﬁxed the laws by which the
mind operates on every part of it so that the parts can do
what they were intended to do. And when we see so many
such examples of a system of unconnected muscles working
together so wonderfully in their separate functions, with no
help from habit, it shouldn’t be thought strange that the
muscles of the eye should, also with no help from habit,
work together to give the eyes the direction they need if they
are to do what they are intended to do.

We see a similar working together in the muscles that
contract the pupils of the two eyes, and in the muscles,
whatever they are, by which the shape of the eyes is varied
according to the distance of the objects ·being looked at·.

But it should be noted that although it appears to be
by natural instinct that both eyes are always turned the
same way, there is still some latitude left for custom. ·I now
explain this·. What I have said about the parallel motion of
the eyes isn’t to be understood too strictly—nature doesn’t
direct us to keep the axes of the eyes always precisely and
mathematically parallel to each other. Indeed, although they
are always nearly parallel they are seldom exactly so. When
we look at an object, the axes of the eyes meet at that object;
so they make an angle, always a small one but larger or
smaller depending on how close the object is. Nature has
very wisely left us the power of varying the parallelism of
our eyes a little, so that we can direct them both to the

same point, whether far or near. No doubt this is learned
by custom, which is why we see that it is a long time before
children do this perfectly.

This natural power of varying the parallelism of the eyes
goes only as far as is needed for the purpose intended by it,
but it can be increased through much practice and straining.
And so we see that some people have become able to distort
their eyes into unnatural directions, just as others have
become able to distort their bodies into unnatural postures.
Those who have lost the sight of one eye commonly lose
what they had acquired by custom, in the direction of their
eyes, but retain what they had by nature. That is, although
their eyes always turn and move together; when they look
at an object the blind eye often deviates from it a little. A
casual observer wouldn’t notice this, but it can be spotted by
someone who is used to making exact observations in these
matters.

11. Seeing objects the right way up by images that
are upside down

Another phenomenon that has puzzled philosophers is our
seeing objects the right way up when it is well known that
their images or pictures on the retina of the eye are inverted.
The sagacious Kepler ﬁrst made the grand discovery that
clear but inverted pictures of visible objects are formed on
the retina by the rays of light coming from the object. The
same great philosopher showed through the principles of
optics how these pictures are formed:

The rays coming from any one point on the object and
falling on the various parts of the pupil are refracted
by the cornea and crystalline lens in such a way that
they meet again at one point on the retina, and there
they paint the colour of the point on the object from

74

Inquiry into the Human Mind

Thomas Reid

6: Seeing

which they come. As the rays from different points on
the object cross each other before they come to the
retina, the picture they form must be upside down;
the upper part of the object being painted on the lower
part of the retina, the right side of the object on the
left of the retina, and similarly with the other parts.

Kepler thought that we see objects the right way up by means
of these inverted pictures for this reason:

As the rays from different points of the object cross
each other before they fall on the retina, ·when they
get there· we conclude that the impulse we feel on
the lower part of the retina comes from above, and
that the impulse that we feel on the higher part comes
from below.

Descartes later gave the same explanation for this phe-
nomenon, and illustrates it by what we think about the
positions of objects that we feel with our arms crossed or
with two sticks that cross each other.

But I can’t go along with this explanation. First, because
it takes our seeing things the right way up to be something
we infer from certain premises, whereas it seems in fact to
be an immediate perception. And, secondly, because the
premises from which all mankind are supposed to draw this
conclusion never entered into the minds of the great majority
of people, and are absolutely unknown to them. We have no
feeling or perception of the pictures on the retina. . . . In order
to see objects the right way up, according to the principles
of Kepler or Descartes, we must already know

•that the rays of light come from the object to the eye
in straight lines;
•that the rays from different points of the object cross
one another before they form the picture on the retina;
and lastly
•that these pictures are really upside down.

All these things are true, and are known to philosophers,
but they are absolutely unknown to the great majority of
mankind; and people who are absolutely ignorant of them
can’t possibly reason from them and build conclusions on
them. . . .
I have had occasion to note many instances
of conclusions drawn. . . .from premises that pass through
the mind very quickly and are never made the objects of
reﬂection; but surely no-one will think it possible to draw
conclusions from premises that never entered into the mind
at all!

Bishop Berkeley having rightly rejected this explanation,
gives one based on his own principles. (He is followed in this
by the judicious Dr. Smith in his Optics.) I shall now explain
and examine the explanation given by that ingenious writer.
Here it is ·in my words·:

The ideas of sight are altogether unlike those of
touch. . . . So we can learn only by experience how
one sense will be affected something that affects the
other sense in such-and-such a way. Shape, position,
and even number (i.e. number of tangible objects) are
ideas of touch; and although there is no resemblance
between these and the ideas of sight, we learn by
experience that a ·tangible· triangle affects the sight
in manner Mt and that a ·tangible· square affects it in
manner Ms; and from this we judge that whatever
affects our sight in manner Mt is a triangle, and
whatever affects it in manner Ms is a square. In the
same way, ﬁnding from experience, that an object the
right way up affects the eye in one way and the same
object upside down affects it in another, we learn
to judge from how the eye is affected whether the
object is the right way up or upside down. In short,
visible ideas are signs of the tangible; and what takes
the mind from the sign to the thing signiﬁed is not

75

•any resemblance between them or •any natural force,
but rather •its having found them constantly con-
joined in experience, as the sounds of a language are
·conjoined· with the things they signify. Thus, if the
images on the retina had always been the right way up
they would have shown the objects the right way up,
just as they now do with the images upside down. . . .
Similarly, if the visible appearance of two shillings had
been found connected from the beginning with the
tangible idea of one shilling, that appearance would
as naturally and readily have signiﬁed one shilling as
it now signiﬁes two.

This opinion is undoubtedly very ingenious; and if it
is sound it will solve to explain not only our present phe-
nomenon but also the one I shall consider next [section 13],
namely our seeing objects single with two eyes.

It is clear that in Berkeley’s explanation it is supposed
that initially—before we have any habits—we don’t see things
either as the right way up or as upside down, as having this
shape or that, as single or double; and that we learn from
experience to use visible signs to tell us objects’ tangible
position, shape, and number.

There is no denying that it’s extremely difﬁcult to distin-
guish the immediate and natural objects of sight from the
conclusions that we have been accustomed from infancy to
draw from them. Berkeley was the ﬁrst to try to distinguish
between them and to trace out the boundary that divides
them. If in doing so he has gone a little off-track on one
side or the other, this might be expected in a subject that
is so intricate and altogether new. The nature of vision
has received great light from this distinction; and many
phenomena in optics which had previously appeared alto-
gether inexplicable have been clearly and sharply explained
by it. When someone has made an important discovery

in philosophy it is natural—almost unavoidable—that he
should take it a little beyond its sphere and to use it to
‘explain’ phenomena that don’t fall within its province. Even
the great Newton, when he had discovered the universal
law of gravitation and seen how many of the phenomena
of nature depend on this and other laws of attraction and
repulsion, couldn’t help expressing his conjecture that all the
phenomena of the material world depend on attracting and
repelling forces in the particles of matter. And I suspect that
the ingenious Berkeley, having found so many phenomena
of vision that are instances of the constant association of
the ideas of sight and of touch, carried this principle a little
beyond its just limits.

In order to judge as well as we can whether this is so,
consider the situation of a man •who is like Dr. Saunderson
in being blind and having all the knowledge and abilities
that a blind man can have, and •who is suddenly made
to see perfectly. Let us suppose him to be kept from all
opportunities of associating his ideas of sight with those of
touch until ·the following experiment is performed·. After
the ideas of sight become a little familiar to him, and his
ﬁrst surprise at the objects of vision has died down, give him
time to check them out and compare them in his mind with
the notions that he formerly had by touch; and in particular
to compare in his mind the •visible extension that his eyes
present to him with the •extension in length and breadth
with which he was previously acquainted ·by touch·.

I have tried ·in section 7· to prove that a blind man can
form a notion of the visible extension and shape of bodies
from how it relates to their tangible extension and shape.
It will be even easier for him, when this visible extension
and shape are presented to compare them with tangible
extension and shape and to perceive that one has length
and breadth as well as the other; that one can be bounded

76

Inquiry into the Human Mind

by straight or curved lines as well as the other. So he will
perceive that there can be visible as well as tangible circles,
triangles, and quadrilateral and multilateral ﬁgures. The
visible shape is coloured and the tangible one isn’t, but that
doesn’t present them from having the same shape, any more
than two objects of touch are prevented from having the
same shape by the fact that one is hot and the other cold.

I have demonstrated that the properties of visible shapes
differ from those of the ·tangible· plane shapes that they
represent; but I noted at the same time that when the object
is small enough to be taken in clearly all at once, and is
placed directly before the eye, the difference between the
visible and tangible shape is too small to be perceived by
the senses. Thus, it is true that in every visible triangle
the three angles are greater than two right angles, whereas
in a ·tangible· plane triangle the three angles are equal to
two right angles; but when the visible triangle is small its
three angles will be so nearly equal to two right angles that
the senses can’t pick up the difference. . . . So we ﬁnd that
small visible shapes—ones that can be seen clearly at one
view—don’t just resemble the plane tangible shapes that
have the same name, but are the same so far as the senses
are concerned. So that if Dr. Saunderson had been made to
see, and had attentively viewed the ﬁgures of the ﬁrst book
of Euclid, he might—just by thinking and without touching
them—have discovered that they were the very ﬁgures he
had previously been so well acquainted with by touch.

When ·tangible· plane ﬁgures are seen obliquely, their
visible shape differs more from the tangible shape; and the
representation of solid [here = ‘three-dimensional’] shapes that
is made to the eye is still more imperfect, because visible
extension has only two dimensions, not three. Still, just
as it can’t be said that an exact picture of a man has no
resemblance to the man, or that a perspectival view of

a house has no resemblance to the house; so it can’t be
properly said that the visible shape of a man or of a house
has no resemblance to the objects they represent.

So Berkeley has built on a serious mistake, in supposing
that there is no resemblance between the extension, shape,
and position that we see and that which we perceive by touch.
I would further remark that Berkeley’s theory regarding
material things must have made him see this question about
the right-way-up appearance of objects in a very different
light from that in which it appears to those who don’t accept
that theory.

In his Theory of Vision Berkeley seems indeed to allow
that there is an external material world; but he believed that
this external world is only tangible, not visible, and that
the visible world—the world accessible only by sight—is not
external but in the mind. If this is accepted, then someone
who says ‘I see things the right way up, and not inverted,’
says that there is a top and a bottom, a right and a left, in
his mind. I’m sorry but I don’t know the topography of the
mind well enough to be able to give meaning to ‘top’, ‘bottom’
etc. when they are applied to it.

So I agree that if visible objects weren’t external, but
existed only in the mind, they couldn’t have shape or ori-
entation or extension; and it would be absurd to say that
they are seen either the right way up or upside down or that
there is any resemblance between them and the objects of
touch. But when I ask ‘Why are objects the right way up
and not upside down?’ I am taking it for granted that we are
not in Berkeley’s ideal world, but in the world that men who
submit to the dictates of common sense believe themselves
to inhabit. I am taking it for granted that the objects both
of sight and of touch are external, and have a certain shape
and a certain orientation in relation to one another and in
relation to our bodies, whether we perceive this or not.

6: Seeing

When I hold my walking-cane upright in my hand and
look at it, I take it for granted that I see and handle the
same individual object. When I say that I feel it as the right
way up I mean that I feel the head directed away from the
ground and the point directed towards it; and when I say
that I see it as the right way up I mean that I see it with the
head directed away from the ground and the point toward
it. I take the ground to be a ﬁxed object both of sight and of
touch, in relation to which an object can be said to be high
or low, the right way up or upside down; and to ask ‘Why do
I see the object the right way up, and not upside down?’ is
like asking ‘Why do I see the object with the orientation that
it really has?’ or ‘Why does the eye show the real orientation
of objects, rather than showing them upside down as they
are seen by a common astronomical telescope or as their
pictures are seen on the retina of an eye when it is dissected?’

12. More on this topic

The only way to give a satisfactory answer to this question is
to point out the laws of nature that apply in vision, for they
are what the phenomena of vision must be regulated by. So
I answer (1) that by a law of nature the rays of light go from
every point on the object to the pupil of the eye in straight
lines. And (2) that by the laws of nature the rays coming from
any one point on the object to the various parts of the pupil
are refracted in such a way that they meet again at one point
on the retina; and the rays from many different points on the
object, ﬁrst crossing each other and then proceeding to that
many different points on the retina, form an upside-down
picture of the object.

The principles of optics tell us—and experience conﬁrms—
that if there is no such picture on the retina there is no vision;
and that how the object appears in respect of colour, shape,

78

clarity or fuzziness, and brightness or faintness, depends on
what the picture on the retina is like.

So it is obvious that the pictures on the retina are, by the
laws of nature, a means of vision; but we know nothing at
all about how they accomplish their end. Philosophers think
that the impression made on the retina by the rays of light
is passed along to the optic nerve, and passed by the optic
nerve to some part of the brain that they call the ‘sensorium’;
and that the impression thus conveyed to the sensorium is
immediately perceived by the mind, which is supposed to
reside there. But we know nothing about where the soul is;
and we don’t perceive immediately what is goes on in the
brain—indeed we know less about the brain than about any
other part of the human body. It is indeed very probable that
the optic nerve is just as essential an instrument of vision as
the retina is, and that the pictures on the retina have some
effect on it. But we know nothing about what kind of effect
this is.

There isn’t the least probability that either the optic nerve
or the brain contains any picture or likeness of the object.
The pictures on the retina are formed by the rays of light;
and whether we side with those who hold that when the rays
bang into the retina they cause some •vibration of the ﬁbres
of the optic nerve, or with those who hold that the impact
of the rays on the retina sets in •motion some subtle ﬂuid
contained in the nerve, neither the •vibration nor the •motion
can resemble the visible object that is presented to the mind.
Nor is there any probability that the mind perceives the
pictures on the retina. These pictures are no more objects of
our perception than the brain is, or the optic nerve. No man
ever saw the pictures in his own eye, nor indeed the pictures
in the eye of someone else until the eye was taken out of the
head and duly prepared ·for microscopic examination·.

Inquiry into the Human Mind

6: Seeing

It is very strange that philosophers ·and scientists· of all

ages should have agreed that

the images of external objects are conveyed by the
organs of sense to the brain, and are there perceived
by the mind.

Nothing could be more unphilosophical, for two reasons.
(1) This thesis has no foundation in fact and observation.
The eye is the only sense-organ, as far as we can discover,
that forms any kind of image of its object; and the images
formed by the eye are not in the brain but at the back of the
eye, and they are not at all perceived or felt by the mind. (2)
It is no easier to conceive how the mind perceives images
•in the brain than to conceive how it perceives things •more
distant. If you show me how the mind can perceive images
in the brain, I will undertake to show you how it can perceive
the most distant objects; for if we give the mind eyes to
perceive what is transacted at home in its dark chamber,
why can’t we make these eyes a little longer sighted? And
if we do that we shall have no need for the unphilosophical
ﬁction of images in the brain!
In short, the manner and
mechanism of the mind’s perception is quite beyond our
understanding; and this way of explaining it, by images
in the brain, seems to be based on very gross notions of
the mind and its operations—implying that the supposed
likenesses in the brain, by a kind of contract, formed similar
ones in the mind, of which the mind is supposed to be
conscious.

I have tried to show throughout this inquiry that the
effects made on the mind by means of the ﬁve senses haven’t
the least resemblance to the objects of sense; and therefore,
as I see no shadow of evidence that there are any such
likenesses in the brain, I see no scientiﬁc purpose that can
be met by supposing them. Since the picture on the retina,
therefore, •isn’t itself seen by the mind, •doesn’t have on

79

the brain or sensorium any effect that is seen by the mind,
and •doesn’t have any effect on the mind that resembles the
object, the question still stands: How does this picture on
the retina cause vision?

Before answering this question, I should point out that
in the operations of the mind, as well in those of bodies,
we must often be satisﬁed with knowing that certain things
are connected and invariably follow one another, without
being able to discover the chain that goes between them.
Such connections are what we call ‘laws of nature’; and
when we say that one thing produces another ‘by a law of
nature’, all we mean is that one thing (in everyday language
called the ‘cause’) is constantly and invariably followed by
another that we call the ‘effect’, and that we don’t know
how they are connected. Thus, we see that it is a fact that
bodies gravitate toward bodies, and that this gravitation is
regulated by certain mathematical proportions depending
upon how far apart the bodies are and the quantity of matter
that each has. Being unable to discover the cause of this
gravitation, and presuming that it is the immediate operation
either of ·God·, the author of nature, or of some subordinate
cause that we haven’t yet discovered, we call it a ‘law of
nature’. If any philosopher some day has the pleasure of
discovering the cause of gravitation, this will have to be by
discovering some more general law of nature from which the
gravitation of bodies necessarily follows. In every chain of
natural causes the highest link is a primary law of nature,
and the highest link that we can ﬁnd by sound induction is
either this primary law of nature or a necessary consequence
of it. Tracing out the laws of nature by induction from the
phenomena of nature is all that true philosophy aims at,
and all it can ever reach. [Remember that ‘philosophy’ also covers
science].

Inquiry into the Human Mind

6: Seeing

There are laws of nature by which the operations of
the mind are regulated; there are also laws of nature that
govern the material system; and just as the latter are the
ultimate conclusions that the human faculties can reach
in the philosophy of bodies, so the former are the ultimate
conclusions we can reach in the philosophy of minds.

Now, I put the question of how the picture on the retina
causes vision in the way that it does. From what I have just
been saying, we can see that the question amounts to this:
By what law of nature is a picture on the retina the
means or occasion of my seeing an external object of
the same shape and colour, with the opposite up-down
orientation, and in a certain direction from the eye?
I am sure it will be agreed that I see the whole object in the
same manner and by the same law by which I see any one
point on it. Now I know it to be a fact that in direct vision I
see every point on the object in the direction of the straight
line that passes from the centre of the eye to that point on
the object; and I also know from optics that the ray of light
that comes to the centre of my eye passes on to the retina in
the same direction. So it seems to be a fact that

every point on the object is seen in the direction of a
straight line passing from the picture of that point on
the retina through the centre of the eye.

As this is a fact that holds universally and invariably, it must
be either a law of nature or the necessary consequence of
some more general law of nature. And according to sound
rules of philosophizing we can regard it as being itself a law of
nature until we discover some more general law from which
it follows (which I suspect can never be done). [Throughout
this discussion Reid mostly uses ‘law of nature’ to mean ‘basic law of
nature’.] Thus we see that •the phenomena of vision lead us
by the hand to •a law of nature, or a law of our constitution;
and a necessary consequence of this is that we see objects

the right way up through upside-down images. . . . My chief
aim in dealing with this question was to point out this law
of nature—a law which is a part of the constitution of the
human mind, and therefore belongs properly to the subject of
this inquiry. So I shall make some further remarks about it,
after doing justice to the ingenious Dr. Porterﬁeld who, long
ago in his Medical Essays or more recently in his Treatise
of the Eye, pointed out, as a primary law of our nature
something which. . . .very nearly coincides with the law that I
have mentioned.

In order, therefore, that we may have a more distinct
notion of this law of our constitution, I shall offer three
observations.

1. We can give no reason why the retina is the only part of
the body on which pictures made by the rays of light cause
vision; so we must set this down to being simply a law of
our constitution. We can use optical glasses to form such
pictures on the hand or on any other part of the body, but we
don’t feel them and they don’t produce anything like vision.
A picture on the retina is no more felt than is a picture on the
hand; but it produces vision—and the only reason for this,
as far as we know, is that the wisdom of nature intended it
for this purpose. The vibrations of the air strike on the eye,
the palate and the olfactory membrane with the same force
as on the ear-drum; their effect on the ear-drum produces
the sensation of sound, while their effects on any of the other
sense-organs produce no sensations at all. This re-applies
to all the senses, each of which has its own special laws
according to which the effects on the organ of that sense
produce sensations or perceptions in the mind that can’t be
produced by effects made on any other organ.

2. The laws governing perception by the different senses
are very different, not only in respect of the nature of the
objects perceived by them but also in respect of how they

80

Inquiry into the Human Mind

6: Seeing

inform us about the distance and situation of the object.
In all of them the object is thought of as external and as
having real existence independently of our perception; but by
one sense (·touch·) the mind is presented with the distance,
shape and situation of the object, by another (·sight·) the
shape and situation but not the distance; and by another
(·hearing·) neither shape, situation or distance. It is no use
invoking the principles of anatomy or natural philosophy
to explain these differences in the manner of perception by
the different senses. Eventually we have to bring it back to
the will of ·God·, our maker, who intended that our powers
of perception should have certain limits, and adapted to
his wise purposes the organs of perception and the laws of
nature by which they operate.

When we hear an unusual sound, the sensation indeed is
in the mind, but we know that something external produced
the sound. At the same time, our hearing doesn’t tell us
whether the sounding body is near or far, in this direction
or that; so we look around to discover it.
If any new
phenomenon appears in the heavens, we see exactly its
colour, its apparent place, size, and shape, but we don’t
see its distance. For all the eye can tell, it may be in the
atmosphere, among the planets, or in the sphere of the ﬁxed
stars.

The testimony of the sense of touch reaches only to
objects that are contiguous to the organ, but with regard to
them it is more precise and detailed. When we feel a body
with our hand, we know its shape, distance and position, as
well as whether it is rough or smooth, hard or soft, hot or cold.
The sensations of touch, seeing and hearing are all in the
mind, and can’t exist except when they are perceived. How
do they all constantly and invariably suggest the conception
of and belief in external objects that exist whether or not they
are perceived? No philosopher can give any answer except

that that is the way we are constituted.

How do we know that the object of touch is at the
ﬁnger’s end and nowhere else? That the object of sight
is in such-and-such a direction from the eye, and in no other
direction, but can be at any distance? and that the object of
hearing can be at any distance, and in any direction? Not by
custom, surely, or by reasoning or comparing ideas, but by
the constitution of our nature. How do we perceive visible
objects in the direction of straight lines perpendicular to that
part of the retina on which the rays strike, while we don’t
perceive the objects of hearing in lines perpendicular to the
ear-drum on which the vibrations of the air strike? Because
such are the laws of our nature. How do we know which
parts of our bodies are affected by particular pains? Not by
experience or by reasoning, but by the constitution of nature.
The sensation of pain is of course in the mind, and can’t
be said to have any relation, from its own nature, to any
part of the body; but because of the way we are built this
sensation gives us a perception of some particular part of
the body whose disorder causes the unpleasant sensation. If
it weren’t so, a man who never before felt either the gout or
toothache might when he ﬁrst had gout in his toe mistake
it for toothache. Every sense, therefore, has its special laws
and limits by the constitution of our nature; and one of the
laws of sight is that we always see an object in the direction
of a straight line passing from its image on the retina through
the centre of the eye.

3. You may want to say: ‘It would be easier and just as
satisfactory to conceive a law of nature by which we always
see objects in the place where they are, and with their true
orientation, without bringing in images on the retina or the
optical centre of the eye.’ To this I answer that nothing can
be a law of nature that is contrary to fact. The laws of nature
are the most general facts we can discover in the operations

81

Inquiry into the Human Mind

Thomas Reid

6: Seeing

of nature. Like other facts, they are not to be found by lucky
guesses but to be soundly derived from observations; like
other general facts, they are to be inferred not from a few
particulars but from a patient and cautious induction from
a large number of particulars. That we see things always in
their true place and orientation is not fact, so it can’t be a
law of nature. In a plane mirror I see myself and other things
in quite different places from those they really occupy; and
this is the case whenever the rays coming from the object are
either reﬂected or refracted before striking the eye. Those
who know anything of optics know that in all these cases
the object is seen in the direction of a line passing from
the centre of the eye to the point where the rays were last
reﬂected or refracted, and that all the powers of the telescope
and microscope depend on this.

Shall we say, then, that it is a law of nature that the object
is seen in the direction. . . .contrary to that of the rays when
they meet the eye? No. This is not true, so it isn’t a law of
nature. For the rays from any one point on the object come to
all parts of the pupil; so they must have different directions;
but we see the object only in one of these directions, namely
that of the rays that come to the centre of the eye. And this
holds true even when the rays that are heading for the centre
are blocked and the object is seen ·only· by rays that pass at
a distance from the centre.

You may think that although we aren’t made so as to
see objects always in their true place, or as precisely in the
direction of the rays when they strike cornea, perhaps we
are made so as to see the object in the direction that the rays
have when they reach the retina after undergoing all their
refractions in the eye—i.e. the direction in which the rays
pass from the crystalline lens to the retina. But this isn’t
true either, and consequently it isn’t a law of our constitution.
To see that it isn’t true, we must conceive all the rays that

pass from the lens to one point on the retina as forming a
small cone whose base is on the back of the lens, and whose
vertex is a point on the retina. Obviously the rays that form
the picture at this point have different directions, even after
they pass the lens; yet the object is seen only in one of these
directions. . . .

From this induction I conclude that our seeing an object
in that particular direction in which we do see it is not a
result of •any law of nature by which we are made to see
it in the direction of the rays, whether before or after their
refractions in the eye, but of •a law of our nature by which
we see the object in the direction of the straight line that
passes from the picture of the object on the retina to the
centre of the eye.

The facts on which I base this induction come taken from
four fascinating experiments by Scheiner and reported by Dr.
Porterﬁeld, and conﬁrmed by his experience. I have repeated
these experiments myself, and found them to agree with the
report. As they are easy to perform and tend to illustrate and
conﬁrm the law of nature I have mentioned, I shall present
them here as brieﬂy and clearly as I can. [In this version, Reid’s
account will be made somewhat briefer still. The omissions will not be
signalled by . . . . ellipses.]

Experiment 1. Place a well-lit pinhead about eighteen
inches from your eye; keep your eye still, looking at the
pinhead steadily. We know that the rays from anyone point
on this object, whether they pass through the centre of the
eye or away from the centre, come together again at one point
on the retina; and that these rays have different directions,
both before they strike the eye and after they pass through
the crystalline lens.

Now make a small pinhole in a card and look at the
pinhead through this hole, moving the card so that different
parts of your eye are in play. When you do this you will be

82

Inquiry into the Human Mind

Thomas Reid

6: Seeing

seeing the pinhead sometimes by rays that are central and
sometimes by rays that are not, with different directions and
different angles to one another (both when they strike the
cornea and when they strike the retina), but always by rays
that come to the same point on the retina. And what is the
upshot? It is that the object is seen in exactly same direction,
whether seen by all these rays together or by any one subset
of them.

Experiment 2. Place the pinhead about four or ﬁve inches
in front of your eye. We know that in this case the rays
coming from one point on the object don’t meet at one point
on the retina, but spread over a small circular spot of it; the
central rays occupying the centre of this spot, the rays that
pass above the centre occupying the upper part of the spot,
and similarly with all the rest. And we know that in this case
the object is seen confused, every point on it being seen not
in one direction but in several. To remedy this confusion,
look at the object through the pinhole, and while you move
the pinhole over the various parts of the pupil the object
won’t keep its ·apparent· place but will seem to move in the
opposite direction!

Take note of this: when the pinhole is moved upward over
the pupil of the eye, the picture of the object is moved upward
on the retina while the object seems to move downward, so
as to be always in the straight line passing from the picture
through the centre of the eye. Bear in mind also that the rays
forming the upper and the lower pictures on the retina don’t
cross each other as in ordinary vision; yet still the higher
picture shows the object lower, and the lower picture shows
the object higher, just as when the rays do cross each other.
One consequence of this, by the way, is that the phenomenon
of our seeing objects with the opposite orientation to that of
their pictures on the retina does not depend on the crossing
of the rays, as Kepler and Descartes thought.

Experiment 3. As in the second experiment, but this
time make three pinholes in a straight line, close enough
together for rays coming from the object through all them to
enter the pupil at the same time. The upshot of this is very
remarkable: the object is seen triple with one eye! And if you
make more holes within the breadth of the pupil, you will
see as many objects as there are holes. But I shall take the
case of three holes—one right, one middle, one left—so that
you see three objects standing in a line from right to left.

Notice that of the three pictures on the retina, the one
on the left is formed by the rays that pass on the left of the
eye’s centre, the middle picture by the central rays, and the
right-hand picture by the rays that pass on the right of the
eye’s centre. It is also important that the object appearing on
the right is not the one seen through the hole on the right,
but the one seen through the hole on the left; and similarly
the object appearing on the left is the one seen through the
hole on the right; this being easily proved by covering ﬁrst
one hole and then the other. Thus, whatever the direction
may be of the rays that form the right-hand and left-hand
pictures, still the right hand picture shows a left-hand object,
and the left-hand picture shows a right-hand object.

Experiment 4. It is easy to see how to vary the second and
third experiments by placing the object too far away to see
clearly. For this purpose I looked at a candle ten feet away,
*and put the eye of my spectacles behind the card, that the
rays from the same point of the object might meet, and cross
each other, before they reached the retina*. [The *asterisked*
portion is in Reid’s exact words.] In this case as in experiment 3,
the candle was seen triple through the three pinholes; but
the candle on the right was seen through the hole on the
right, and the left-hand candle through the hole on the left.
The principles of optics make it clear that in this experiment
the rays forming the several pictures on the retina cross

83

Inquiry into the Human Mind

6: Seeing

each other a little before they reach the retina; so that the
left-hand picture is formed by the rays that pass through
the hole on the right; so that the position of the pictures is
opposite to that of the holes through which they are formed,
and therefore also opposite to that of their objects, as we
have found it to be in the former experiments.

These experiments exhibit several unusual phenomena
relating to the apparent place of visible objects and their
apparent direction from the eye—phenomena that seem to
go ﬂatly against the common rules of vision. ·I shall mention
ﬁve ways in which they do so·. (i) When we look at the same
time through three holes that are in a straight line and at
certain distances from each other, we expect that the objects
seen through them should really be and should appear to
be at a distance from each other; yet by experiment 1 we
can through three such holes see a single object and a single
point on that object; and through each of the three it appears
in the same place and direction.

(ii) When the rays of light come from the object in straight
lines to the eye, without any reﬂection, bending or refraction,
we expect the object to appear in its real and proper direction
from the eye, and so it usually does. But in experiments
2, 3 and 4 we see the object in a direction that isn’t its
true and real direction from the eye, although the rays come
from the object to the eye without any bending, reﬂection or
refraction.

(iii) When both the object and the eye are kept perfectly
still, and the medium ·through which the light rays pass·
is unchanged, we expect the object to appear to be at rest,
staying in the same place. But in experiments 2 and 4, when
both the eye and the object are at rest and the medium
unchanged, we make the object appear to move upward or
downward or in any direction we please.

(iv) When we look at the same time and with the same

eye through holes that stand in line from right to left, we
expect the object seen through the left-hand hole to appear
on the left, and the object seen through the right-hand hole
to appear on the right. But in experiment 3 we ﬁnd the exact
opposite.

(v) Although there are many situations where we see a
single object as double, using two eyes, we always expect
it to appear single when seen through by one eye. But in
experiments 2 and 4 we have cases where a single object can
appear double, triple or quadruple to one eye, with no help
from a polyhedron or multiplying glass.

All these extraordinary phenomena relating to the direc-
tion of visible objects from the eye, as well as those that are
common and ordinary, take us back to the law of nature that
I have mentioned, of which they are necessary consequences.
There is no probability that we’ll ever be able to give a reason
why pictures on the retina make us see external objects
while pictures on the hand or on the cheek do not, or why
we see the object in the direction of a line passing from its
picture through the centre of the eye rather than in any other
direction. So I am inclined to look on this law as a primary
·or basic· law of our constitution.

Don’t misunderstand me.

I am not saying that •the
picture on the retina will make us see •an object—in the
direction mentioned or in any other!—independently of
whether •the optic nerve and the other more immediate
instruments of vision are in good working order. We don’t
have a good grasp of what the task of the optic nerve is,
or of how it performs that task; but it seems to be certain
that it has some part in the faculty of seeing, because in
an amaurosis—·blindness with no apparent change in the
eye·—which is believed to be a disorder of the optic nerve,
the pictures on the retina are clear and distinct, and yet
there is no vision.

84

Inquiry into the Human Mind

Thomas Reid

6: Seeing

We know still less of the use and function of the choroid
membrane; but it seems also to be necessary for vision;
for it is well known that pictures on that part of the retina
where it isn’t covered by the choroid. . . .produce no vision. . . .
So I acknowledge that the retina is not the last and most
immediate instrument of the mind in vision. There are other
physical organs whose operation is necessary for seeing,
even after pictures have been formed on the retina. If we
ever come to know the structure and use of the choroid
membrane, the optic nerve and the brain, and what effects
are had on them by means of pictures on the retina, we may
come to •see some more links of the chain and to •discover a
more general law of vision. But when we know so little of the
nature and function of these more immediate instruments
of vision, it seems impossible to trace vision’s laws beyond
the pictures on the retina. Nor would I deny that there may
be diseases of the eye, or accidents, which can lead to our
seeing objects in a direction somewhat different from the
one mentioned above. [Reid then describes some evidently
permanent defects in his own vision, caused by inadvertently
glimpsing the sun through a telescope.]

13. Seeing objects single with two eyes

Another phenomenon of vision that deserves attention is our
seeing objects single with two eyes. There are two pictures
of the object, one on each retina, and each picture by itself
makes us see an object in a certain direction from the eye;
yet both together usually make us see only one object. All
the accounts or explanations of this that anatomists and
philosophers have given seem to be unsatisfactory. I shall
pass over the opinions of Galen, of Gassendi, of Baptista
Porta, and of Rohault. The reader can see these examined
and refuted by Dr. Porterﬁeld. ·In sections 18-19· I shall

examine Dr. Porterﬁeld’s own opinion, Bishop Berkeley’s,
and some others. But ﬁrst we must be sure of the facts about
single and double vision, for if we don’t get the phenomena
right, it’s ten to one that we’ll be led astray regarding the
causes. ·The process of describing the phenomena can shade
into the process of explaining them·. The next paragraph
explains why. It presents something that we ought carefully
to attend to; it is accepted in theory by everyone who has any
true judgment or sound instincts in inquiries of this kind,
but it is very often overlooked in practice.

In explaining natural phenomena, the furthest that our
faculties can take us is this: from •particular phenomena we
can by induction trace out •general phenomena of which all
the particular ones are necessary consequences. When we
have arrived at the most general phenomena we can reach,
there we must stop. ‘Why did •that leaf gravitate toward the
earth?’—we can only answer ‘Because •all bodies gravitate
toward the earth’. This explains a particular phenomenon
through a general one. ‘Why do all bodies gravitate toward
•the earth?’—the only explanation we can give is ‘Because all
bodies gravitate toward •each other’. This explains a general
phenomenon through a more general one. ‘Why do all bodies
gravitate to one another?’—we have no answer; but if we
did, it could only be by bringing this universal gravitation
of bodies under some other still more general phenomenon
of which the gravitation of all bodies is a special case. The
most general phenomena we can reach are what we call ‘laws
of nature’. So that the laws of nature are nothing but the
most general facts relating to the operations of nature, which
include a great many particular facts under them.
If we
sometimes label as a law of nature something that we later
discover comes under something still more general, there is
no great harm done. . . .Now let us consider the phenomena
of single and double vision, in order to discover some general

85

Inquiry into the Human Mind

Thomas Reid

6: Seeing

principle to which they all lead and from which they all
follow. If we can discover any such general principle, it must
be either •a law of nature or •the necessary consequence of
some law of nature; and its authority will be equal either
way. ·The material to be presented in this section will be in
nine episodes·.

1. We ﬁnd that when the eyes are sound and perfect, and
the axes of both are directed to one point, an object placed
at that point is seen single; and I would point out here that
in this case the two pictures that show the object single are
in the centres of the retinas. As an aid to keeping things
clear, ·I shall introduce a couple of mildly technical terms·.
When two pictures of a small object are formed at points on
the retina, if they show the object single I shall call those
points ‘corresponding points’ on the retina. If they show the
object as double, I shall say that the points on the retina at
which the pictures are formed ‘do not correspond’. Now, in
this ﬁrst phenomenon it is evident that the two centres of
the retina are corresponding points.

2. When the eyes are sound and perfect, and the axes of
both are directed to one object, other objects appear single if
they are at the same distance from the eyes as the object to
which their axes are directed. I direct my eyes to a candle ten
feet away while another candle stands at the same distance
from me and within my ﬁeld of vision. While I am looking at
the ﬁrst candle, I can attend to how the second appears to
my eyes, and I ﬁnd that in this case it too always appears
single. An important point here is that the pictures of the
second candle don’t fall on the centres of the retinas; either
they fall on the right, or both to the left, and both are at the
same distance from the centres. This is easy to show from
the principles of optics. In this second phenomenon of single
vision, therefore, it seems that the corresponding points are
points of the two retinas that are similarly placed in relation

to the two centres, being both on the same side of the centre
and at the same distance from it. It also appears from this
phenomenon that every point on one retina corresponds with
the similarly placed point on the other.

3. When the eyes are sound and perfect, and the axes of
both are directed to one object, other objects appear double
if they much nearer to the eyes or much further from them
than the object to which the two eyes are directed. Thus, if a
candle is placed ten feet away and I hold my ﬁnger at arm’s
length between my eyes and the candle: when I look at the
candle I see my ﬁnger double, and when I look at my ﬁnger I
see the candle double; and the same thing happens with all
other objects at such distances that fall within the sphere of
vision. Those who understand the principles of optics will
realise that the pictures of the objects that are seen double
don’t fall on points on the retinas that are similarly placed,
whereas the pictures of the objects seen single do fall on
points that are similarly placed. From this I infer that while
the points on the two retinas that are similarly placed in
relation regard to the centres do correspond, those that are
not similarly placed do not correspond.

4. Notice this: in cases such as I have just described we
have been accustomed from infancy to see objects double
that we know to be single, custom and experience of the
singleness of the object never take away its appearance of
doubleness.

5. I would point out, though, that if you make a regular
practice of attending to visible appearances, this will have
a considerable effect, making a difference to how much of
the phenomenon of double vision you notice and remember.
Someone may honestly say that he never saw things double
all his life; but when he is put into the position described
in 3 above, he will immediately see the candle double when
he looks at his ﬁnger; and his ﬁnger double when he looks

86

Inquiry into the Human Mind

Thomas Reid

6: Seeing

at the candle. Does he now see differently from how he saw
before? No, surely; it’s just that he attends to what he never
attended to before. The same double appearance of an object
has been presented to his eye a thousand times before now;
but he didn’t attend to it; and so it is as little an object
of his reﬂection and memory as if it had never happened.
·This general phenomenon of as-it-were-not-seeing what one
doesn’t attend to deserves a couple of paragraphs to itself·.
When we look at an object, surrounding objects can
be seen at the same time, although more obscurely and
indistinctly; for the eye has a considerable ﬁeld of vision,
which it takes in all at once. But we attend only to the
object we look at. The other objects that lie within the ﬁeld of
vision are not attended to; and therefore it’s as though they
weren’t seen. If any of them draws our •attention it naturally
draws the •eyes at the same time, because in the ordinary
course of things the eyes always follow the attention; and
when they are separated, as in a day-dream, we hardly see
what is directly in front of us. So we can see why the man
I have been talking about thinks that he never before saw
an object double. When he looks at any object, he sees it
single and doesn’t notice other visible objects at that time,
whether they appear single or double. If any of them draws
his attention, it draws his eyes at the same time; and as
soon as the eyes are turned toward the object it appears
single. But in order to see things double—or at least to have
any reﬂection or memory of doing so—he has to •look at
one object while •attending to the faint appearance of other
objects that are within his ﬁeld of vision. He may never have
done this, or even tried to, so he doesn’t recollect that ever he
saw an object double. But when he is set to work to give this
attention, he immediately sees objects double in the way and
with the same details as those who have given this attention
through most of their lives.

There are many phenomena like this, showing that the
mind can •not attend to, and thereby in a way •not perceive,
objects that strike the senses. I mentioned several examples
in chapter 2; and I have been assured by people who are
highly skilled in music that when they are hearing a tune on
the harpsichord, while they attend to the treble they don’t
hear the bass, and while they attend to the base they don’t
perceive the tune in the treble. . . .

6. It is observable that whenever we see an object double
the two appearances have a certain position in relation to one
another, and a certain apparent. . . .distance. This apparent
distance is greater or less in different circumstances; but
in the same circumstances it is always the same, even to
different persons.

Thus in the experiment mentioned above, if twenty differ-
ent people who see perfectly with both eyes place their ﬁnger
and the candle at the stated distances and hold their heads
upright, in looking at •the ﬁnger they will see two candles,
one on the right and the other on the left. The one seen
on the right is seen by the right eye, the one seen on the
left by the left eye; and they—·the twenty people·—will see
them at the same apparent distance from each other. And if
they look at •the candle they will see two ﬁngers, one on the
right and the other on the left; and they will all see them at
the same apparent distance; the ﬁnger toward the left being
seen by the right eye and the other by the left eye. If the
twenty people all tilt their heads 90º to one side, with the
other circumstances remaining the same, one appearance of
the object that is seen double will be directly above the other.
In a word, however you choose to vary the circumstances,
the appearances will be varied in one and the same manner
to all the spectators.

7. Having made many experiments to study the apparent
distance between the two appearances of an object that is

87

Inquiry into the Human Mind

Thomas Reid

6: Seeing

seen double, I have found this [what follows expands Reid’s text a
little, in ways that ·small dots· can’t easily indicate]:- When a single
object is seen double,

•let x be the point on the retina of the left eye where
the picture of the object is made,
•let y be the point on the retina of the right eye where
the picture is made, and
•let z be the point on the retina of right eye that is
situated similarly to x.

Then what I have found is that the apparent distance be-
tween the two appearances is proportional to the distance
between y and z. Thus, just as the apparent distance
between •two objects seen with one eye is proportional to
the arc of the retina that lies between their pictures, so also
when an object is seen double with two eyes, the apparent
distance between the two appearances is proportional to the
arc of either retina which lies between •the picture in that
retina and •the point in that retina corresponding to the
point that has the picture in the other retina.

8. Just as in certain circumstances we invariably see
one object appear double, so in others we equally invari-
ably see two objects unite into one and in appearance lose
their doubleness. This is evident in the appearance of the
binocular telescope. And the same thing happens when one
looks through two similar tubes in a parallel direction: we
see only one tube; and if two similar coins are placed at the
ends of the two tubes, one exactly in the axis of one eye
and the other in the axis of the other eye, we see only one
coin. If two coins (or other bodies) with different colour and
shapes are properly placed in the two axes of the eyes and at
the ends of the tubes, we see both the bodies in one and the
same place, each as it were spread over the other, without
hiding it; and the colour will be what you get from putting
those two colours together.

9. From these phenomena, and from all the experiments
I have been able to conduct, it seems clear that in perfect
human eyes the centres of the two retinas correspond and
harmonize with one another; and that every other point in
one retina corresponds and harmonizes with the point that
is similarly situated on the other retina, in such a way that
•pictures on the corresponding points of the two retinas
show only one object even when there are really two
objects, and •pictures on points of the retinas that
don’t correspond show us two visible appearances
even when there is really only one object.

So that pictures on corresponding points of the two
retinas present the same appearance to the mind as if they
had both been on the same point on one retina; and pictures
on non-corresponding points of the two retinas present to the
mind the same apparent distance and position of two objects
as if one of those pictures were on the point corresponding to
it on the other retina. I offer this. . . .not as an hypothesis but
as a general fact or phenomenon of vision. All the phenomena
of single or double vision that I have described lead to it and
are necessary consequences of it. It holds true invariably
in all perfect human eyes, as far as I can discover from
countless experiments made on my own eyes and many
made by others at my request. Most of the hypotheses
that have been contrived to explain single and double vision
presuppose this general fact without their authors’ being
aware of it. [Reid adds a few details to that, in relation to
work by Isaac Newton and Robert Smith, author of A System
of Optics.] So this general phenomenon appears to be based
on a very full induction, which is all the evidence we can
have for a fact of this kind. Before I ﬁnish with this subject I
ought to ask ·and answer· some questions:

•Do animals whose eyes are on opposite sides of their
heads and point in opposite directions have such

88

Inquiry into the Human Mind

Thomas Reid

6: Seeing

corresponding points in their retinas? (·section 14·)
•What is the position of the corresponding points in
imperfect human eyes, I mean in those who squint?
[sections 15-16, not included in this version]
•Is this harmony between the corresponding points in
the retinas natural and original or rather the effect of
custom?
•If it is original, can it be explained by any of the laws
of nature already discovered, or should it itself be
regarded as a law of nature and a part of the human
constitution?

·The last two questions will be the topic of section 17. After
that, in sections 18-19, I shall discuss the views of some
other writers concerning single and double vision·.

14. The laws of vision in brute animals

In giving eyes to animals, nature intends that the animals
should be able to perceive the situation of visible objects, or
the direction in which they are placed. So it is probable that
in ordinary cases every animal, however many eyes it has
and of whatever structure, sees objects •single and •in their
true and proper direction. And since there is an enormous
variety among the structures, motions and number of eyes
in different animals and insects, it is probable that the laws
governing vision are not the same in all, but are variously
adapted to the eyes that nature has given the animals in
question.

Mankind naturally turn their eyes always the same way,
so that the axes of the two eyes meet at one point. They
naturally attend to or look at only the object that is placed
at the point where the axes meet. And whether the object is
more or less distant, the shape of the eye is adapted to the
distance of the object so as to form a clear picture of it.

When we use our eyes in this natural way, the two
pictures of the object we look at are formed at the centres
of the two retinas; and the two pictures of any contiguous
object are formed at points of the retinas that are similarly
situated in relation to the centres. So if we are to see objects
single and in their proper direction, with two eyes, all we
need is to be so constituted that objects whose pictures
are formed on the centres of the two retinas, or on points
similarly situated in relation to these centres, shall be seen
in the same visible place. And this is the constitution that
nature has actually given to human eyes.

There are two, and only two, states of affairs in which
we (1) see one object double, or (2) see two objects run
together into one. Each involves conduct on our part that
is unnatural, but that can be learned by practice: (1) We
distort our eyes so that their axes aren’t parallel; (2) We
direct the axes of the two eyes to one point while directing
our attention to some visible object that is much nearer or
much more distant than that point. In these cases, (1) the
two pictures of the same object are formed at points on the
retinas that are not similarly situated, and so the object is
seen double; or (2) the two pictures of different objects are
formed at points on the retinas that are similarly situated,
and so the two objects are seen run together in one place.

So it seems that the laws of vision in the human con-
stitution are wisely adapted to the natural use of human
eyes, but not to unnatural uses of them. We see objects
truly when we use our eyes in the natural way, but have
false appearances presented to us when we use them in an
unnatural way. We may reasonably think that the case is
the same with other animals. But isn’t it unreasonable to
think that animals which •naturally turn one eye toward one
object and another eye toward another object must thereby
have presented to them false appearances such as we have

89

Inquiry into the Human Mind

Thomas Reid

6: Seeing

when we •unnaturally do the same thing?

Many animals have their eyes so placed by nature that
the axes of the two eyes are always in opposite directions.
Do objects painted on the centres of the two retinas appear
to such animals as they do to human eyes, in one and the
same visible place? I think it is highly probable that they
don’t, and that they appear as they really are, in different
places.

Judging by analogy with the human case, we will think
that there is a certain correspondence between points of the
two retinas in such animals, but that it is a different corre-
spondence relation from the one we have found in human
eyes. The centre of one retina will correspond with the centre
of the other in such a way that the objects whose pictures are
formed on these corresponding points will appear not to be
in the same place (as in human eyes) but in different places.
Similarly, the upper part of one retina will correspond with
the lower part of the other, and the front part of one will
correspond with the back part of the other.

Some animals are naturally able easily to turn their eyes
in the same direction or different directions, as we turn
our hands and arms. Do these animals have corresponding
points on their retinas, and points that don’t correspond,
as we have? I think that probably they don’t, because in
them such a constitution would only serve to present them
with false appearances. If we judge from analogy, that will

lead us to think •that because such animals move their eyes
in a manner like the way we move our arms, they have
an immediate and natural perception of the direction they
are pointing their eyes in, as we have of the direction we
give to our arms; and •that they perceive the situation of
visible objects by their eyes in a manner like that in which
we perceive the situation of tangible objects with our hands.
We can’t teach brute animals to use their eyes in any way
other than in that which nature has taught them, nor can
we teach them to tell us the appearances that visible objects
make to them, either in ordinary or in extraordinary cases.
So we don’t have the same means of discovering the laws
of vision in them as we have for mankind, and must rest
content probable conjectures. What I’ve said about this is
chieﬂy intended to show that animals to which nature has
given eyes that differ in their number, their position and
their natural motions may well be subject to different laws
of vision, adapted to the special features of their organs of
vision.

Chapter 6 (cont’d): Seeing

17. The effect of custom in seeing objects single

From the phenomena of single and double vision that I
presented in section 13, it seems that our seeing an object
single with two eyes depends on two things—on •the mutual
correspondence of certain points of the retinas that I have
often described, and •on the two eyes’ being directed to
the object so accurately that the two images of it fall on
corresponding points. We need both of these if we are to see
an object single with two eyes; and as far as they depend on
custom, so far—and no further—can single vision depend
on custom. With regard to the accurate direction of both
eyes to the object, I think we have to accept that this is only
learned by custom. Nature has wisely ordained the eyes to
move in such a way that their axes will always be nearly
parallel; but it has left it in our power to vary a little the
angle between them, depending on how far away the object
is that we are looking at. If we weren’t able to do this, objects
would appear single at one particular distance only, and
would always appear double at distances much less or much
greater. Nature’s wisdom is conspicuous in giving us this
power, and just as conspicuous in making the extent of it
exactly adequate to the purpose. The parallelism of the eyes
in general is therefore the work of nature, but the precise
and accurate direction, which must be varied according to
the distance of the object, is the effect of custom. The power
that nature has left us of •varying a little the angle between
the optic axes is turned into a habit of •giving them always
the angle that is right for the distance of the object.

What gives rise to this habit? The answer has to be that it
comes from being found necessary for perfect and clear vision.

A man who has lost the sight of one eye often loses the habit
of directing it exactly to the object he is looking at ·with the
other eye· because that habit is no longer useful to him. If
he regained the sight of his eye, he would regain this habit
by ﬁnding it useful. No part of the human constitution is
more admirable than that whereby, without any design or
intention, we acquire habits that are found useful. Children
must see imperfectly at ﬁrst, but by using their eyes they
learn to use them in the best way, and to acquire—without
intending to—the habits that are necessary for that purpose.
Every man becomes most expert in that kind of vision that
is most useful to him in his particular profession and way
of life. A painter of miniatures or an engraver sees very near
objects better than a sailor does, but the sailor sees very
distant objects much better than do the painter and the
engraver. A person who is short-sighted gets the habit in
looking at distant objects of contracting the aperture of his
eyes by almost closing his eyelids. Why? Simply because
this makes him see the object more clearly. In the same way,
the reason why every man acquires the habit of directing
both eyes accurately to the object must be because this lets
him see it more perfectly and clearly. A question remains to
be considered: The correspondence between certain points
on the retinas that is also necessary for single vision—is it
the effect of custom or rather an original property of human
eyes?

A strong argument for its being an original property
·rather than acquired through custom· can be drawn from
the habit I have just been discussing—the habit of directing
the eyes accurately to an object. We get this habit through
ﬁnding it necessary for perfect and distinct vision. But why

91

Inquiry into the Human Mind

Thomas Reid

6: Seeing

is it necessary for that? Simply for this reason:

Because of this habit, the two images of the object
fall on corresponding points ·of the retinas·, and thus
the eyes assist each other in vision, and the object is
seen better by both eyes together than it could be by
one. But when the eyes are not accurately directed,
the two images of an object fall on non-corresponding
points of the retinas, and thus the sight of one eye
disturbs the sight of the other, and the object is seen
less clearly with both eyes than it would be with one.
This makes it reasonable to conclude that this correspon-
dence between certain points on the retinas is prior to the
habits we acquire in vision, and consequently is natural and
original. We have all acquired the habit of always directing
our eyes in a particular manner that causes single vision.
Now, if nature has ordained that we should have single vision
only when our eyes are thus directed, there’s an obvious
reason why all mankind should agree in the habit of directing
them in that way. If on the other hand single vision were
the effect of custom, any other habit of directing the eyes
would have done just as well; there would be no explanation
of why everyone has this particular habit; and it would seem
very strange that no one instance has been found of a person
who had acquired the habit of seeing objects single with both
eyes while they were directed in any other manner.

In his excellent System of Optics the judicious Dr. Smith
maintains the contrary opinion, and offers some reasonings
and facts in support of it. He agrees with Berkeley in
attributing it entirely to custom that we see objects single
with two eyes, as well as that we see objects the right way up
by upside-down images. I considered Berkeley’s reasonings
in section 11; now let me make some remarks about what
Dr. Smith has said on the subject. I approach him with the
respect due to an author to whom the world owes •valuable

discoveries of his own and also •discoveries by ·Newton·, the
brightest mathematical genius of his age—discoveries which
Smith, with great labour, generously rescued from oblivion.
He observes that the question ‘Why do we see objects
single with two eyes?’ is of the same kind as the question
‘Why do we hear sounds single with two ears?’, and that the
same answer must hold for both questions. He means us to
infer from this observation that because the second of these
phenomena is the effect of custom, the ﬁrst is so as well.

My humble opinion is that the questions are not so much
of the same kind that the same answer must hold for both;
and that in any case our hearing single with two ears is not
the effect of custom.

Two or more visible objects, although perfectly alike and
seen at the very same time, can be distinguished by their
visible places; but two perfectly similar sounds heard at the
same time can’t be distinguished, because from the nature
of sound the sensations they cause must coalesce into one.
Why do we hear sounds single with two ears? I answer:
not from custom, but because two sounds that are perfectly
alike and simultaneous have nothing by which they can be
distinguished. But will this answer ﬁt the other question? I
think not.

The object makes an appearance to each eye, as the
sound makes an impression on each ear; to that extent
the two senses agree. But the visible appearances can be
distinguished by place even when they are perfectly alike in
every other respect; the sounds can’t; and that is a difference
between the two senses. Indeed, if the two appearances have
the same visible place, they won’t be distinguishable as
two any more than the sounds were, and in that case we’ll
see the object single. But when they don’t have the same
visible place, they are perfectly distinguishable and we see
the object double. We see the object single only when the

92

eyes are directed in one particular manner; while we are
capable of directing them in many other ways which lead to
our seeing the object double.

Dr. Smith rightly attributes to custom the well known
tactual illusion in which a button pressed with two opposite
sides of two contiguous ﬁngers that are crossed is felt double.
I agree with him that the cause of this appearance is that
those opposite sides of the ﬁngers have not been accustomed
to feeling the same object, but two different objects, at the
same time. And I would add this: just as custom produces
this phenomenon, so a contrary custom destroys it; for if a
man frequently accustoms himself to feel the button between
his crossed ﬁngers he will eventually feel it single—as I have
found by experience.

It can be taken for a general rule that things that are
produced by custom can be undone or changed by disuse
or by a contrary custom. So it’s a strong argument that an
effect isn’t due to custom but to the constitution of nature,
when a contrary custom is long continued without changing
it or weakening it. I take this to be the best rule by which
we can settle our present question. I shall therefore mention
·and critically discuss· two facts that Dr. Smith adduces to
show that the corresponding points of the retina have been
changed by custom; and then I shall cite some facts tending
to show that there are corresponding points on the retinas
of the eyes originally, and that custom produces no change
in them. ·Here is the ﬁrst of Dr Smith’s facts·:

. . . .The Reverend Mr. Foster of Clinchwarton, hav-
ing been blind for some years from amaurosis, was
restored to sight by a treatment with mercury; and
when he ﬁrst began to see again, all objects appeared
to him double; but gradually the two appearances
came closer together, and eventually he came to see
single and as clearly as he did before going blind.

I have three comments on this.
(1) It doesn’t prove any
change of the corresponding points on the eyes unless we
suppose something that has not been afﬁrmed, namely that
when Mr. Foster saw double he was directing his eyes to the
object with the same accuracy, and in the same manner, as
he did later when he saw single. (2) Even if we do suppose
this, no explanation can be given of why at ﬁrst the two
appearances should be seen at such-and-such a particular
angular distance rather than another; or why this angular
distance should gradually decrease until eventually the ap-
pearances coincided. How could custom produce this effect?
(3) Every detail of this case can be explained consistently
with supposing that Mr. Foster had corresponding points in
the retinas of his eyes from the time he began to see, and that
custom made no change regarding them. All we need ·for
our explanation· is to suppose something that is common
in such cases, namely that through some years of blindness
he had lost the habit of directing his eyes accurately to an
object, and that he gradually recovered this habit when he
came to see.

The second fact mentioned by Dr. Smith is taken from

Mr. Cheselden’s Anatomy. It is this:

A gentleman who had one eye distorted by a blow
on the head found every object appear double; but
gradually the most familiar ones became single, and
eventually all objects became so, all without any
improvement in the distortion ·of his eye·.

Notice that it isn’t said that the two appearances gradually
came closer to one another and eventually united into one,
without any improvement in the distortion. This would
indeed have been a decisive proof of a change in the cor-
responding points of the retinas, though not one that could
be explained in terms of custom. But it isn’t said ·that this is
what happened; so it probably isn’t what happened, because·

93

6: Seeing

such a remarkable detail would have been mentioned by
Mr. Cheselden, as it was by the person who reported on Mr
Foster’s case. So we can take it for granted that one of the
appearances gradually vanished, without approaching the
other. I can see several ways in which this might happen. (1)
The sight of the distorted eye might gradually grow weaker
because of the injury, so that the appearances presented by
that eye would gradually vanish. (2) A small and unnoticed
change in the manner of directing the eyes, might occasion
his not seeing the object with the distorted eye. . . . (3) By
acquiring the habit of directing one and the same eye always
to the object, the faint and oblique appearance presented
by the other eye might, when it became familiar, be so little
attended to that it wasn’t perceived. One of these causes,
or more of them acting together, could produce the effect
mentioned without any change of the corresponding points
of the eyes.

For these reasons, the facts mentioned by Dr. Smith, al-
though challenging and interesting, seem not to be decisive.
The following facts ought to be put in the opposite scale.
(1) In the famous case of the young gentleman couched [see
the explanation on page 53] by Mr. Cheselden, after having had
cataracts on both eyes until he was thirteen years of age, it
seems that he saw objects single from the time he began to
see with both eyes. Mr. Cheselden’s words are:

And now being lately couched of his other eye, he says
that objects at ﬁrst appeared large to this eye, but
not as large as they did at ﬁrst to the other eye; and
looking at the same object with both eyes, he thought
it looked about twice as large as when seen with only
the ﬁrst couched eye—but not double, so far as we
can discover.

(2) The three young gentlemen mentioned in section 16,
who (as far as I know) had squinted since infancy, as soon as

94

they learned to direct both eyes to an object, saw it single. In
these four cases it seems clear that the centres of the retinas
corresponded originally, before custom could produce any
such effect; for Mr. Cheselden’s young gentleman had never
been accustomed to see at all before he was couched, and
the other three had never been accustomed to direct the axes
of both eyes to the object.

(3) From the facts adduced in section 13, it appears that
from the time we are capable of observing the phenomena of
single and double vision, custom makes no change in them.
I have occupied myself with making such observations
for more than thirty years; and in every case where I saw
the object double at ﬁrst, I see it double to this day, despite
knowing from constant experience that it is single. In other
cases where I know there are two objects there appears only
one, after thousands of trials.

Let a man look at a familiar object through a polyhedron
or multiplying glass every hour of his life, the number of
visible appearances will be the same at last as at ﬁrst; it
doesn’t make the least difference how often this is tried or
for how long.

Effects produced by habit must vary according to the
frequency of the acts by which the habit is acquired; but the
phenomena of single and double vision are so invariable and
uniform in all men, are so exactly regulated by mathematical
rules, that I think we have good reason to conclude that they
are effects not of custom but of ﬁxed and unchanging laws
of nature.

18. Dr. Porterﬁeld’s account of single and double
vision

Bishop Berkeley and Dr. Smith seem to attribute too much
to custom in vision; Dr. Porterﬁeld too little. This ingenious
writer thinks that by an original law of our nature, lying
deeper than custom and experience, we perceive visible
objects in their true place— not only in their true direction
but also at their true distance from the eye—and that’s his
basis for his explanation of why we see objects single with
two eyes:- Having the power to perceive the object with each
eye •in its true place, we must perceive it with both eyes •in
the same place, and so we must perceive it single.

He realizes that this principle, though it accounts for our
•seeing objects single with two eyes, doesn’t at all account
for our •seeing objects double. Other writers on this subject
take it to be a sufﬁcient cause for •double vision that we
have two eyes, and only ﬁnd difﬁculty in assigning a cause
for •single vision; but Dr. Porterﬁeld’s principle ·reverses
this and· throws all the difﬁculty on the other side.

To explain double vision, therefore, he advances another
principle, without saying whether he takes it to be an original
law of our nature or the effect of custom. This is it:

Our natural perception of the distance of objects from
the eye doesn’t apply to all the objects within the ﬁeld
of vision, but only to the object we directly look at; and
objects off to the side, whatever their real distance
from us may be, are seen at the same distance as
the object we look at, as though they were all on the
surface of a sphere with the eye at its centre.

Thus, •single vision is accounted for by our •seeing the true
distance of an object that we look at; and •double vision
by •a false appearance of distance in objects that we don’t
directly look at.

I agree with this learned and ingenious author that it is
by a natural and original principle that we see visible objects
in a certain direction from the eye, and I honour him as the
person who ﬁrst made this discovery; but I can’t assent to
either of those principles by which he explains single and
double vision, for the following ·ﬁve· reasons.

(1) Our having a natural and original perception of the
distance of objects from the eye seems to be contrary to
a well attested fact; for the young gentleman couched by
Mr. Cheselden imagined at ﬁrst that everything he saw
touched his eye, just as what he felt touched his hand.

(2) Our perception of the distance of objects from the eye,
whether it is from nature or from custom, isn’t as accurate
and determinate as it would have to be to produce single
vision. A mistake of the twentieth or thirtieth part of the
distance of a small object such as a pin ought, according to
Dr. Porterﬁeld’s hypothesis, to make it appear double. Very
few can judge the distance of a visible object with that sort
of accuracy; yet we never ﬁnd double vision produced by
mistaking the distance of the object. Even when looking with
the naked eye, we often mistake the distance of an object by
a half or more; why do we see such objects single? When
I move my spectacles from my eyes towards a small object
two or three feet away, the object seems to come nearer
and eventually appears to be at about half its real distance
·from my eyes·, but I see it single at that apparent distance
just as well as when I see it with the naked eye at its real
distance. And when we look at an object with a binocular
telescope properly ﬁtted to the eyes, we see it single while it
appears ﬁfteen or twenty times nearer than it is. So there
are few cases where the distance of an object from the eye
is seen as accurately as is necessary for single vision, on
Dr Porterﬁeld’s hypothesis. This seems to be a conclusive
argument against his explanation of single vision.

95

Inquiry into the Human Mind

Thomas Reid

6: Seeing

We also ﬁnd that false judgments or fallacious appear-
ances of the distance of an object do not produce double
vision. This seems to be a conclusive argument against Dr
Porterﬁeld’s account of double vision.

(3) Our perception of objects’ distances from ourselves
seems to be wholly the effect of experience. I think this has
been proved by Bishop Berkeley and by Dr. Smith; and when
I come to set out the means of judging distance by sight, you
will see that they are all provided by experience.

(4) Supposing that by a law of our nature the •distance of
objects from the eye were perceived most accurately, as well
as their •direction, it still wouldn’t follow that we must see
the object single. Let us now consider what help such a law
of nature would give us in answering the question of whether
the objects of the two eyes are in the very same place and
consequently are not two but one.

Suppose then two straight lines, one from the centre of
one eye to its object and the other from the centre of the other
eye to its object. This law of nature ·of Dr Porterﬁeld’s· gives
us •the direction and •the length of each of these straight
lines, and that is all that it gives. These are geometrical
data, and we can learn from geometry what questions they
can answer. Well, then, can they tell us whether the two
straight lines terminate at one point? No indeed! In order to
determine that we need answers to three other questions:

Are the two straight lines in one plane?
What angle do they make?
How far apart are the centres of the eyes?

When these things are known, we must apply the rules of
trigonometry in order to learn whether the objects of the two
eyes are in the very same place and consequently whether
they are two or one.

(5) The false appearance of distance which is offered as
explaining double vision •can’t be the effect of custom, for

96

constant experience contradicts it; and it •doesn’t have the
features of a law of nature, because it doesn’t serve any good
purpose, or indeed any purpose at all except to deceive us.
But why should we look for arguments about what does or
doesn’t appear to us? The question is,

At what distance do the objects now in my ﬁeld of
vision appear? Do they all appear at one distance, as
if placed on the concave surface of a sphere with the
eye at its centre?

Surely every man can know this with certainty; and if you
will just attend to the testimony of your eyes you needn’t
ask a philosopher how visible objects appear to you. It is
indeed true that when I look up to a star in the heavens
the other stars that appear at the same time do appear
in •this manner. But this phenomenon doesn’t favour Dr.
Porterﬁeld’s hypothesis, for the stars and heavenly bodies
don’t appear at their true distances when we look directly
at them any more when we see them off to the side; and if
this phenomenon is an argument for Dr. Porterﬁeld’s second
principle, it must destroy the ﬁrst.

I shall explain the true cause of this phenomenon later,
so I set it aside for the present. Take another case: I sit in
my room and direct my eyes to the door, which appears to be
about sixteen feet away; at the same time I see many other
objects faintly and off to the side of my ﬁeld of vision—the
ﬂoor, the rug, the table that I write on, papers, ink-stand,
candle etc. Do all these objects appear to be sixteen feet
away? On the closest attention I ﬁnd that they do not.

19. Dr. Briggs’s theory and Sir Isaac Newton’s
conjecture on this subject

I’m afraid that you will now be tired of the subject of single
and double vision—as I am! The topic has become complex
and confused, as a result of two equal causes: •the multitude
of theories advanced by famous authors, and •the multitude
of facts observed without sufﬁcient skill in optics or reported
without attention to the most important and decisive details.
In order to bring it to some sort of conclusion, I have
in section 13 given a fuller and more orderly account than
anyone had previously given of the phenomena of single
and double vision in those whose sight is perfect, and have
brought them under one general principle which appears to
be a law of vision in human eyes that are perfect and in their
natural state.

In section 14 I have given reason to think that this law
of vision, although excellently adapted to the way human
eyes are constructed and placed, can’t serve the purposes of
vision in some other animals, and therefore very probably
isn’t common to all animals. [Reid then returns for a page or
so to squinting, which was the topic of sections 15 and 16,
omitted from this version.]

In section 17 I have tried to show that the correspondence
and working-together of certain points of the two retinas,
under which I have brought all the phenomena of single
and double vision, is not (as Dr. Smith thought) the effect
of custom, nor is it changed by custom; it is a natural and
original property of human eyes; and—in section 18—that it
is not due to an original and natural perception of the true
distance of objects from the eye, as Dr. Porterﬁeld thought.
After this recapitulation, which is intended to ease things for
you, I shall embark on some more theories on this subject.
The theory of Dr. Briggs, ﬁrst published in English in

the Philosophical Transactions and afterwards in Latin under
the title Nova visionis theoria—with a preface consisting of a
letter from Sir Isaac Newton to the author—amounts to this:
The ﬁbres of
the optic nerves running from
•corresponding points of the retinas to the thalami
of the optic nerves ·in the brain· have the same length,
the same tension, and a similar situation, so they will
have the same tone; and therefore their vibrations
caused by the impact of the rays of light will be like
a musical unison, and will present one and the same
image to the mind; but the ﬁbres passing from •parts
of the retinas that don’t correspond will have different
tensions and tones, will have discordant vibrations,
and will therefore present different images to the
mind.

I shan’t discuss this theory in detail. It is enough to make
the general point that it is a system of conjectures about
things of which we are entirely ignorant, and that all such
theories in philosophy deserve to be laughed at rather than
seriously refuted.

From the ﬁrst dawn of philosophy right down to this day
it has been believed that the optic nerves are intended to
carry the images of visible objects from the back of the eye to
the mind, and that the nerves belonging to the organs of the
other senses have a similar role. But how do we know this?
We conjecture it and then, taking this conjecture for a truth,
we think about how the nerves might best serve this purpose.
For many ages the system of the nerves was taken to be •a
hydraulic engine consisting of a bundle of pipes that carry
to and fro a liquid called ‘animal spirits’. Around the time of
Dr. Briggs, the nervous system was thought rather to be •a
stringed instrument, composed of vibrating chords each of
which had its own particular tension and tone. But some,
just as plausibly, conceived it to be a •wind instrument that

97

Inquiry into the Human Mind

Thomas Reid

6: Seeing

played its part by the vibrations of an elastic ether [= ‘extremely
ﬁne gas’] in the ﬁbres of the nerves.

These, I think, are all the engines into which the nervous
system has been moulded by philosophers for conveying
the images of sensible things from the sense-organ to the
sensorium [= ‘sensory part of the brain’]. And nothing that we
know gets in the way of anyone’s freely choosing the theory
that he thinks is best for the purpose, for none of them can
claim to be better supported by facts and experiments than
are the others.
Indeed, they all seem to be such clumsy
devices for carrying images that a man would be tempted to
invent a new one! Well, in the dark a blind man can guess as
well one who sees, so I venture to offer another conjecture
about the nervous system—one that will serve the purpose
as well as those I have mentioned, and has the virtue of
simplicity. ·It is offered in a spirit of instructive fun·. I shall
state it for the special case of the nerves relating to vision.

Why can’t the optic nerves be made up of empty tubes
opening their mouths wide enough to receive the •rays
of light that form the image on the retinas, and gently
conveying •them—safely and in their proper order—to
the very seat of the soul where they ﬂash in her face?
It is easy for an ingenious philosopher to ﬁt the calibre of
these empty tubes to the diameter particles of light so that
nothing larger will get in. And if there is a risk that the rays
will lose their way, an expedient can be found to prevent this:
simply give the tubes of the nervous system a peristaltic
motion like that of the alimentary canal.

This hypothesis has a special advantage ·over the other
three I have mentioned·. All philosophers believe that
the. . . .likenesses of things are conveyed by the nerves to
the soul, but none of their hypotheses show how this could
be done. For how can the likenesses of sound, taste, smell,
colour, shape and all sensible qualities be made out of the

vibrations of musical chords, or the undulations of animal
spirits or of ether? We ought not to suppose means that
are inadequate to the end.
Isn’t it just as philosophical,
and more intelligible, to conceive that the soul receives her
likenesses by a kind of nervous swallowing, as the stomach
receives its food? I might add that to account for muscular
motion we need only to continue this peristaltic motion of
the nervous tubes from the sensorium to the ends of the
nerves that serve the muscles.

Thus nature will be in harmony with herself: sensation
will be the conveying of idea-food to the mind, and muscular
motion will be the expulsion of the waste products. For who
can deny that the likenesses of things conveyed by sensation
can after appropriate digestion be excreted by muscular
motion?. . . .
I hope that in time this hypothesis may be
developed into a system as philosophical as that of animal
spirits or the vibration of the nervous ﬁbres!

To be serious now: in the operations of nature I regard the
theories of a philosopher that are unsupported by facts with
as little respect as I do the dreams of a sleeping man or the
ravings of a madman. We laugh at the Indian philosopher
who explained the support of the earth by inventing the
hypothesis of a huge elephant, and to support the elephant
a huge tortoise. If we are honest about it, we’ll admit that we
don’t know any more about how the nerves operate than
he did about how the earth is supported; and that our
hypothesis about animal spirits, or about the tension and
vibrations of the nerves, are as likely to be true as is his
hypothesis about the support of the earth. His elephant
was a hypothesis, and our hypotheses are elephants! Every
theory in philosophy that is built on pure conjecture is an
elephant; and every theory that is supported partly by fact
and partly by conjecture is like the statue of Nebuchadnezzar
with feet partly of iron and partly of clay.

The great Newton set philosophers an example that al-
ways ought to be but rarely has been followed, by distinguish-
ing his •conjectures from his •conclusions and putting the
former by themselves in the modest form of questions. This
is fair and legal; but any other kind of philosophical trafﬁc
in conjectures ought to be regarded as contraband and illicit.
Indeed his conjectures often have more foundation in fact
and more plausibility than the dogmatic theories of most
other philosophers; so we shouldn’t overlook the conjecture
he has offered concerning the cause of our seeing objects
single with two eyes, in the 15th query in his Optics:

When an object is seen with both eyes, isn’t what
happens the following? The likenesses of the object
are united at the place where the optic nerves meet
before they come into the brain,

•the ﬁbres on the right side of both nerves
uniting there, and then going on into the brain
in the nerve on the right side of the head, and
•the ﬁbres on the left side of both nerves uniting
in the same place, and then going on into the
brain in the nerve on the left side of the head;
and these two nerves meet in the brain in such a way
that their ﬁbres make just one likeness or picture,

•half of which on the right side of the sensorium
comes from the right side of both eyes through
the right side of both optic nerves to the place
where the nerves meet and from there on the
right side of the head into the brain, and
•the other half on the left side of the sensorium
comes in the same way from the left side of
both eyes.

For the optic nerves of animals that look in the same
direction with both eyes—such as men, dogs, sheep,
oxen etc.—meet before they come into the brain; but

99

the optic nerves of animals that don’t look in the
same direction with both eyes—such as ﬁshes and the
chameleon—do not meet, if I am rightly informed.

Let me divide this question into two, which are of very differ-
ent kinds, one being purely anatomical, the other relating to
the carrying of likenesses or pictures of visible objects to the
sensorium.

The ﬁrst question is this:

Do the ﬁbres coming from corresponding points of the
two retinas unite at the place where the optic nerves
meet, and continue united from there to the brain;
so that the right optic nerve after the meeting of the
two nerves is composed of the ﬁbres coming from the
right sides of the two retinas, and the left of the ﬁbres
coming from the left sides of the two retinas?

This is undoubtedly a challenging and reasonable question;
because if we could ﬁnd anatomical grounds for answering it
in the afﬁrmative, it would lead us a step forward in discov-
ering the cause of the correspondence and working-together
that there is between certain points of the two retinas. For
although we don’t know what the particular function of
the optic nerves is, it is probable that vision requires some
impression that is had on them and passed along their ﬁbres;
and whatever such impressions are, we can say that if two
ﬁbres are united into one, an impression made on one of
them is likely to have the same effect as would the same
impression made on both. Anatomists think that when two
parts of the body work together this is sufﬁciently explained
by their being served by branches of the same nerve; so
we should look on it as an important discovery in anatomy
if it were found that a single nerve sent branches to the
corresponding points of the retinas.

Inquiry into the Human Mind

6: Seeing

But has any such discovery been made? No, not in a
single case. as far as I can learn. And in several cases the
contrary seems to have been discovered. Dr. Porterﬁeld has
passed on detailed reports. . . .of two cases where the optic
nerves, after touching one another as usual, appeared to
be reﬂected back to the same side from which they came,
without any mixing of their ﬁbres. Each of these persons
had lost an eye some time before his death, and the optic
nerve belonging to that eye had shrunk so that it could
be distinguished from the other at the place where they
met. Another case that Dr Porterﬁeld reports from the same
source is still more remarkable; for in it the optic nerves
didn’t touch at all; and yet those who had known the person
best when he was alive declared (when asked about this) that
he never complained of any defect in his sight, or of seeing
objects double. . . . Other writers also afﬁrm that they have
encountered cases where the optic nerves didn’t touch.

These observations were made before Sir Isaac Newton
put his question; I don’t know whether he was ignorant of
them, or whether he suspected some inaccuracy in them
and wanted the matter to be looked into more carefully.
But from a report by the most accurate Winslow it doesn’t
seem that later observations have been more favourable to
Newton’s conjecture. [Reid then quotes a passage implying
that sometimes there is a partial cross-over of ﬁbres and
sometimes not.]

When I consider this conjecture of Sir Isaac Newton’s •on
its own merits, it seems more ingenious and more plausible
than anything else that has been offered on the subject; and
I admire Newton’s caution and modesty in proposing it only
as something to be looked into. But when I consider it •in the
light of the observations of anatomists that contradict it, I am
naturally led to the thought all we’ll get from trusting to the
conjectures of men of the greatest genius in the operations

of nature is a chance to go wrong in an ingenious manner!
The second part of Newton’s question is:

Are the two likenesses of objects from the two eyes
united into one likeness or picture at the place where
the optic nerves meet, half of this picture being carried
from there to the sensorium by the right optic nerve,
and the other half by the left? And are these two
halves put together again at the sensorium in such a
way as to make one likeness or picture?

Here it seems natural to put my previous question: What
reason do we have to believe that pictures of objects are
carried at all to the sensorium, whether by the optic nerves
or by any other nerves? Isn’t it possible that this great
philosopher, like many lesser ones, was ﬁrst led into this
opinion by education, and then retained it because he never
thought of calling it into question? I admit that this was
my own situation for much of my life. But then something
happened that started me thinking seriously about what
reason I had to believe it, and I couldn’t ﬁnd any. It seems to
be a mere hypothesis, as much as the Indian philosopher’s
elephant.
I am not conscious of any pictures of external
objects in my sensorium, any more than in my stomach; the
things that I perceive by my senses appear to be external
to me and not in any part of my brain; and my sensations
- properly so-called—in no way resemble external objects.
The conclusion from everything I have said about our seeing
objects single with two eyes is this: •By an original property
of human eyes, objects painted at the centres of the two
retinas or at points similarly situated in relation to the
centres, appear in the same visible place; •the most plausible
attempts to explain this property of the eyes have been
unsuccessful; and therefore •it must be either a primary law
of our constitution or a consequence of some more general
law that isn’t yet discovered.

I have now ﬁnished what I intended to say about •the
visible appearance of things to the eye and about •the laws of
our constitution by which those appearances are presented
to us. But I noted at the start of this chapter that the
visible appearances of objects serve only as signs of their
distance, size, shape, and other tangible qualities. The
•visible appearance is presented to the mind by •nature,
according to laws of our constitution that I have explained.
But the •thing signiﬁed by that appearance is presented to
the mind by •custom.

When someone speaks to us in a familiar language we
hear certain sounds, and that is the only effect that his
discourse has on us by nature; but by custom we understand
the meaning of these sounds, and so we ﬁx our attention not
on the sounds but on the things signiﬁed by them. Similarly,
by nature we see only the visible appearance of objects, but
we learn by custom to interpret these appearances and to
understand their meaning. And when we have learned this
visual language and it has become familiar to us, we attend
only to the things signiﬁed and ﬁnd it very difﬁcult to attend
to the signs by which they are presented. The mind passes
from one to the other so rapidly, and so familiarly, that
no trace of the sign is left in our memory, and we seem
to perceive the signiﬁed thing immediately and without the
intervention of any sign.

When I look at the apple-tree that stands before my
window, I perceive, at the ﬁrst glance its distance and size,
the roughness of its trunk, the lay-out of its branches, the
shapes of its leaves and fruit. I seem to perceive all these
things immediately. The visible appearance that presented
them all to the mind has entirely escaped me; even when it
stands before me I can’t attend to it without great difﬁculty
and laborious abstraction. Yet it is certain that this visible
appearance is all that is presented to my eye by nature,

and that I learned by custom to infer all the rest from it. If
this were the ﬁrst time I had ever seen anything, I wouldn’t
perceive either the distance or tangible shape of the tree,
and it would have required the practice of seeing for many
months to change that original perception that nature gave
me by my eyes into what I now have by custom.

The objects that we see naturally and originally, as I
pointed out earlier, have length and breadth but no thickness
and no distance from the eye. Custom, by a kind of sleight of
hand, gradually withdraws these original and proper objects
of sight and substitutes in their place objects of touch, which
have length, breadth, thickness and a determinate distance
from the eye. My next topic is: how this change is brought
about, and what forces in the human mind are involved in it.

20. Perception in general

•Sensation and •the perception of external objects by the
senses have commonly been considered as one and the same
thing, though really they are very different in their natures.
The purposes of common life give us no need to distinguish
them, and the accepted opinions of philosophers tend rather
to run them together; but ·they are distinct from one another,
and· if we don’t attend carefully to their distinctness we can’t
possibly get a sound conception of how our senses operate.
The simplest operations of the mind aren’t capable of being
logically deﬁned; all we can do is to describe them, so as to
lead those of you who are conscious of them in yourselves
to attend to them and reﬂect on them; and it is often very
difﬁcult to describe them so as to produce this result.

The same form of words is used to denote •sensation and
•perception, which makes us apt to look on them as things
of the same nature. Thus:

101

Inquiry into the Human Mind

Thomas Reid

6: Seeing

I feel a pain.
I see a tree.

The ﬁrst denotes a sensation, the second a perception. The
grammatical analysis of the two expressions is the same, for
both consist of an active verb and an object. But if we attend
to the things signiﬁed by these expressions we shall ﬁnd that
in the ﬁrst the distinction between the act and the object is
not real but grammatical; in the second the distinction is not
just grammatical but real.

The form of the expression ‘I feel pain’ might seem to
imply that the feeling is something distinct from the pain
felt, but in reality they are not distinct. Just as ‘thinking a
thought’ is an expression that can’t signify anything more
than ‘thinking’ does, so ‘feeling a pain’ signiﬁes no more than
‘being pained’. What I have just said about pain is true of
every other mere sensation. It is difﬁcult to give examples
because very few of our sensations have names; and when
a sensation does have a name it will also be the name of
something else that is associated with the sensation. But
when we attend to the sensation by itself, and separate it
from other things that are linked with it in the imagination, it
appears •to be something that can’t exist except in a sentient
mind, and •not to be distinct from the act of the mind by
which it is felt.

Perception, as I here understand it, always has an •object
distinct from the •act by which it is perceived—an object
that can exist whether or not it is perceived. I perceive a
tree that grows just outside my window: there is here an
•object that is perceived, and an •act of the mind by which
it is perceived; and these two are not only distinguishable
but are extremely unalike in their natures. The object is
made up of a trunk, branches and leaves; but the act of
the mind by which it is perceived has no trunk, branches

or leaves! I am conscious of this act of ·my· mind and I can
reﬂect on it; but it is too simple to admit of an analysis ·or
deﬁnition·, and I can’t ﬁnd proper words to describe it. I ﬁnd
nothing that resembles it so much as the •memory of the
tree or the •imagining of it; yet both of these differ essentially
from •perception, and they also differ from one another. It
is useless for a philosopher ·such as Hume· to assure me
that •imagining the tree, •remembering it, and •perceiving
it are all one, and differ only in degree of liveliness. I know
better, for I am as well acquainted with all three of those
as I am with the rooms in my own house. I also know this:
•perceiving an object implies both •conceiving of its form and
•believing in its present existence. I know, moreover, that
this belief isn’t the effect of arguments and reasoning; it is
the immediate effect of my constitution.

I am aware that this belief that I have in perception stands
exposed to the big guns of scepticism. But they don’t have
much effect on it. The sceptic asks me:

Why do you believe in the existence of the external
object that you perceive?

Reply: This belief, sir, is not made by me; it came from the
mint of nature; it bears her image and ofﬁcial stamp, and,
if it isn’t right that’s not my fault; I took it on trust, without
suspicion.

Sceptic: Reason is the only judge of truth, and you
ought to rid yourself of every opinion and every belief
that isn’t based on reason.

Reply: Why, sir, should I trust the faculty of •reason more
than that of •perception? They came out of the same
workshop and were made by the same craftsman; and if
he puts one piece of false ware into my hands, what’s to stop
him from putting another? Perhaps the sceptic will agree to
distrust reason rather than give any credence to perception.
He may argue like this:

102

Inquiry into the Human Mind

Thomas Reid

6: Seeing

Since you concede that the object that you perceive
and the act of your mind by which you perceive it
are quite different things, either can exist without the
other: just as the object can exist without being per-
ceived, so the perception can exist without an object.
There is nothing so shameful in a philosopher as to
be deceived and deluded; and therefore you ought to
resolve ﬁrmly to withhold assent, and to get rid of
all this belief in external objects, which may be all
delusion.

For my part, I will never attempt to get rid of it. The sober
part of mankind won’t be much concerned to know my
reasons, but if they can be of use to any sceptic, here they
are. (1) It isn’t in my power ·to get rid of my belief in external
objects·, so why should I waste time trying to do so? It would
be enjoyable to ﬂy to the moon, and to make a visit to Jupiter
and Saturn; but when I know that nature has bound me
down by the law of gravitation to this planet that I inhabit,
I rest content and quietly allow myself to be carried along
in its orbit. Well, my belief is carried along by perception as
irresistibly as my body is carried along by the earth. And
the greatest sceptic will ﬁnd that this holds for him too. He
may struggle hard to disbelieve the information of his senses,
like a man struggling to swim against a current; but ah! it
is useless. It is useless for him to strain every nerve, and
to wrestle with nature and with every object that impinges
on his senses. For after all this effort, when his strength is
exhausted in the forlorn attempt, he will be carried down the
current with the common herd of believers.

(2) I think that it wouldn’t be prudent to throw off this
belief, even if I could. If nature intended to deceive me and
lead me astray by false appearances, and I by my great
cunning and profound logic discovered this, prudence would
dictate to me that I should put up with this indignity as

quietly as I could and not call nature an impostor to her
face, for fear that she would get even with me in some other
way. What do I gain by resenting this injury? ‘You ought
at least not to believe what she says.’ This indeed seems
reasonable if she intends to lead me astray. But what is the
consequence? I resolve not to believe my senses. I break
my nose against a post that comes in my way; I step into a
canal; and after twenty such wise and rational actions I am
arrested and dumped into a mad-house. Now, I admit that
I would rather be one of the •credulous fools whom nature
leads astray than one of the •wise and rational philosophers
who resolve to withhold assent at all this expense. If a man
pretends to be a sceptic with regard to what his senses tell
him, yet prudently keeps out of harm’s way as other men do,
he must excuse my suspicion that either he is a hypocrite
or he is deceiving himself. For if the scales of his belief were
so evenly poised as to lean no more to one side than to its
opposite, his actions couldn’t possibly be directed by any
rules of ordinary prudence.

(3) Although those two reasons are perhaps two more
than enough, I shall offer a third. For a considerable part
of my life I completely trusted what nature told me through
my senses, before I had learned enough logic to be able to
start a doubt about this. And now when I think back on my
past, I don’t ﬁnd that I have been led astray by this belief.
I ﬁnd that without it I would have perished by a thousand
accidents. I ﬁnd that without it I would have been no wiser
now than when I was born. I wouldn’t even have been able
to acquire the logic that suggests these sceptical doubts with
regard to my senses. So I regard this instructive belief as one
of nature’s best gifts. I thank ·God ·, the author of my being,
who gave it to me before the eyes of my reason were opened
and still gives it to me as a guide in matters where reason
leaves me in the dark. And now I follow the direction of my

103

Inquiry into the Human Mind

Thomas Reid

6: Seeing

senses not merely from instinct but also from conﬁdence
and trust in a reliable and kindly guide—trust based on my
experience of his paternal care and goodness.

In all this I deal with the author of my being in just the
way I have thought it reasonable to deal with my parents
and teachers. I instinctively believed whatever they told me,
long before I had the idea of a lie or thought of the possibility
of their deceiving me. Afterwards, I found on reﬂection that
they had acted like fair and honest people who wished me
well.
I found that if I hadn’t believed what they told me
before I could give any reason for doing so, I would even
today have been little better than an imbecile. And although
my natural credulity has sometimes led to my being imposed
on by deceivers, it has been of inﬁnite advantage to me on
the whole; and so I consider my credulity as another good
gift of nature. And the trust that I used to give •instinctively
I continue to give •thoughtfully to those of whose integrity
and truthfulness I have had experience.

People don’t generally realise how greatly •the testimony
of nature given by our senses resembles •testimony of men
given by language. Our trust in both is at ﬁrst an effect
purely of instinct. When we grow up and begin to reason
about them, our trust in human testimony is restrained and
weakened by our experience of being deceived. But our trust
in the testimony of our senses is established and conﬁrmed
by the uniformity and constancy of the laws of nature.

Our perceptions are of two kinds: some are •natural and
original, others are •acquired and the result of experience.
When I perceive that

this is the taste of cider and that of brandy,
this is the smell of an apple and that of an orange,
this is the noise of thunder and that the ringing of bells,
this is the sound of a coach passing and that the voice of

a friend,

these perceptions and others like them are not original; they
are acquired. But the perception that I have by touch of the
hardness and softness of bodies, of their extension, shape
and motion, isn’t acquired; it is original. With all our senses
there are many more acquired perceptions than original
ones—and especially in the case of sight. By this sense we
perceive •originally

only the visible shape and colour of bodies, and their

visible place;

but we •learn to perceive by the eye

almost everything that we can perceive by touch.

The •original perceptions of this sense serve only as signs
to introduce the •acquired ones. The signs by which objects
are presented to us in perception are the language in which
nature speaks to man; it is in many ways like the language
in which men speak to one another, and especially in this:
both ·languages· are partly •natural and original and •partly
acquired by custom. Our original or natural perceptions
are analogous to the •natural language of man to man,
which I discussed in chapter 4, and our acquired perceptions
are analogous to •artiﬁcial language which, in our mother
tongue, is acquired in much the same way as our acquired
perceptions, as I shall explain ·in section 24·.

It is not only healthy adults who acquire by habit many
perceptions that they didn’t have originally—the same is true
for children, idiots, and lower animals.
[In Reid’s day, ‘idiot’
meant ‘person who is seriously mentally defective’.] Almost every
employment in life has perceptions of this kind that are
special to it. The shepherd knows every sheep in his ﬂock
the way we know our acquaintances, and can pick them out
of another ﬂock one by one. The butcher knows by sight the
weight and quality of his cattle and sheep before they are
killed. The farmer perceives by his eye roughly how much
hay there is in a haystack, or how much corn in a heap. The

104

Inquiry into the Human Mind

6: Seeing

sailor sees from a great distance what a ship’s build and
carrying capacity are, and how far away it is. Every man
accustomed to writing tells his acquaintances apart by their
hand-writing, as he does by their faces. And the painter
distinguishes in paintings the styles of all the great masters.
In short, acquired perception varies greatly from person to
person, because of the variety in the objects to which the
perceptions are directed and the different ways people go
about perceiving them.

•Perception ought to be distinguished not only from
•sensation but also from the knowledge of the objects of
sense that is acquired by •reasoning. There is no reasoning
in perception, as I have already observed. The belief that
is implied in perception is an effect ·not of reasoning but·
of instinct. But there are many facts concerning sensible
objects that we can infer from what we perceive, and such
•conclusions of reason ought to be distinguished from •what
is merely perceived. When I look at the moon, I perceive it
to be sometimes circular, sometimes crescent-shaped and
sometimes in between. This is simple perception, and is
the same in the philosopher as in the clown; but from these
various appearances of the moon’s illuminated part I infer
that it is really spherical in shape. This conclusion isn’t
obtained by simple perception but by reasoning. •Simple
perception relates to •the conclusions of reason drawn from
our perceptions in the same way as •the axioms in math-
ematics relate to •the propositions ·inferred from them·. I
can’t demonstrate that

two quantities that are equal to the same quantity are
equal to each other;

neither can I demonstrate that

the tree that I perceive exists.

But by the constitution of my nature my belief is irresistibly
carried along by my grasp of the axiom; and by the consti-

tution of my nature my belief is just as irresistibly carried
along by my perception of the tree. All reasoning is from
principles. The ﬁrst principles of mathematical reasoning are
mathematical axioms and deﬁnitions, and the ﬁrst principles
of all our reasoning about existing things are our perceptions.
The ﬁrst principles of every kind of reasoning are given us
by nature, and have as much authority as does the faculty
of reason—which is also a gift of nature. The conclusions
of reason are all built on ﬁrst principles, and can’t have
any foundation but that. So it is quite proper that such
principles refused to be tried by reason, and laugh at the
artillery of the logician when it is aimed at them.

When a long train of reasoning is needed to demonstrate
a mathematical proposition, it is easily distinguished from
an axiom, and they seem to be things of a very different
nature. But some propositions lie so near to axioms that it
is hard to decide whether they should be •held as •axioms
or rather •demonstrated as •propositions. The same thing
holds with regard to perception and the conclusions drawn
from it. Some of these conclusions follow our perceptions so
easily, and are so immediately connected with them, that it
is hard to ascertain the boundary dividing them from one
another.

Perception, whether original or acquired, doesn’t involve
any use of reason; and it is something that adults have in
common with children, idiots, and lower animals. The •more
obvious conclusions inferred by reason from our perceptions
constitute what we call ‘common understanding’, which
is what men steer by in the common affairs of life, and
what distinguishes them from idiots. The •more remote
conclusions that are inferred by reason from our perceptions
constitute what we commonly call ‘science’ concerning the
various parts of nature— whether in agriculture, medicine,
mechanics or any part of natural philosophy. When I see

105

Inquiry into the Human Mind

Thomas Reid

6: Seeing

a garden in good order, containing a great variety of plants
of the best kinds and in the most ﬂourishing condition, I
immediately infer from these signs that the gardener has
worked hard and skillfully. When a farmer gets up in the
morning and sees that the neighbouring brook overﬂows his
ﬁeld, he infers that a great deal of rain has fallen in the night.
Seeing his fence broken and his corn trodden down, he infers
that some of his own or his neighbour’s cattle have broken
loose. Seeing that his stable door is broken open and some
of the horses gone, he infers that a thief has taken them.
He traces the prints of his horses’ feet in the soft ground,
and from them he discovers which road the thief has taken.
These are instances of common understanding, which is so
close to perception that it’s hard to draw the line between
them. Similarly, the science of nature is so close to common
understanding that we can’t see where the latter ends and
the former begins. I perceive that:

Bodies lighter than water ﬂoat in water while those
that are heavier sink.

From this ·item of common understanding· I infer ·something
that is closer to the science of nature, namely· that

If a body immersed in water stays wherever it is put,
whether at the top or bottom, it weighs exactly the
same as water. If it stays put only when part of it is
above the water, it is lighter than water; and the bigger
the proportion of it that is above water the lighter the
body is. If it had no gravity at all, it would have no
effect on the water and would stand wholly above it.
Thus every man has by •common understanding a rule by
which he judges of the speciﬁc gravity of bodies immersed in
water; and a step or two more leads him into •the science of
hydrostatics.

The whole of what we know about nature, i.e. about
existing things, can be compared to a tree: perception is the

root of this tree of knowledge, common understanding is its
trunk, and the sciences are its branches.

21.
perception

Nature’s way of bringing about sense-

Although there is no reasoning in perception, nature ordains
that certain means and instruments shall intervene between
the object and our perception of it; and these means and in-
struments limit and regulate our perceptions.(1) If the object
isn’t in contact with the organ of sense, some medium—·i.e.
some intervening things or stuff·—must pass from the object
to the organ. Thus,

in vision the rays of light,
in hearing the vibrations of elastic air,
in smelling the efﬂuvia of the body that is smelled,

must pass from the object to the organ; otherwise we have no
perception. (2) There must be some action or effect [Reid’s word
is ‘impression’] on the organ of sense, either by the immediate
application of the object or by the medium that goes between
the object and the organ. (3) The nerves that go from the
brain to the organ must receive some effect by means of the
effect that was made on the organ; and probably by means
of the nerves some effect must be made on the brain. (4)
The effect made on the organ, nerves and brain is followed
by a sensation. (5) Lastly, this sensation is followed by the
perception of the object.

Thus our perception of objects is the result of a sequence
of operations, some of which affect only the body, others
affect the mind. We don’t know much about the nature of
some of these operations; we don’t know anything about how
they are connected to one another or how they contribute to
the perception that results from them all together; but by the
laws of our constitution this is how we perceive objects—and

106

Inquiry into the Human Mind

Thomas Reid

6: Seeing

our only way of doing so.

There may be other beings who can perceive external
objects without rays of light or vibrations of air or efﬂuvia
of bodies, without effects on bodily organs, even without
sensations. But we are so built by ·God·, the author of
nature, that we could be surrounded by external objects and
yet perceive none of them. Our capacity for perceiving an
object lies dormant until it is roused and stimulated by a
certain corresponding sensation. And this sensation isn’t
always available, for it enters into the mind only as a result
of a certain corresponding effect that the object has on the
sense-organ.

Let us track down, as far as we can, this correspondence
of effects, sensations and perceptions, starting with what
comes ﬁrst, namely the effect on the bodily organ. But, alas!
we don’t know what these effects are, let alone how they
cause sensations in the mind.

We know that one body can act on another by •pressure,
by •impact, by •attraction, by •repulsion and probably in
many other ways that we don’t know and don’t have names
for. But in which of these ways

objects that we perceive act on the sense-organs,
these organs act on the nerves, and
the nerves act on the brain,

we don’t know. Can anyone tell me how in vision the rays
of light act on the retinas, how the retinas acts on the optic
nerve and how the optic nerve acts on the brain? No-one can.
When I feel the pain of the gout in my toe, I know that there
is some unusual effect made on that part of my body. But
what kind of effect? Are the small vessels swollen by some
intrusive. . . .ﬂuid? Are the ﬁbres abnormally stretched? Are
they torn apart by force, or eaten away by some acid? I
can’t answer any of these questions. All that I •feel is pain,
which is an effect on the mind, not on the body; and all

that I •perceive through this sensation is that something
wrong in my toe leads to this pain. But because I don’t know
the natural state of my toe when it is not in pain, I also
don’t know what change or disorder in its parts leads to
this painful sensation. Similarly with every other ·kind of·
sensation, there is doubtless some effect on the sense-organ
but we don’t know what it is. It is too subtle to be discovered
by our senses, and we can make a thousand conjectures
about it without coming near to the truth. If we understood
the structure of our sense-organs in such detail that we
could learn what effects external objects have on them, this
knowledge wouldn’t add anything to our perception of the
object; for those who know least about what happens in
perception perceive as clearly as the greatest experts. ·For
perception to occur·, it is necessary •that the effect be made
on our organs, but not •that it be known. Nature carries
on this part of the process of perception without our being
aware of it or helping it along.

But we can’t be unaware of the next step in this process,
the sensation of the mind that always immediately follows
the effect made on the body. It is essential to a sensation
to be felt, and it can’t be anything more than we feel it to be.
We can know our sensations perfectly, if we will just get the
habit of attending to them. But how are the sensations of the
mind produced by impressions on the body? Of this we are
absolutely ignorant, having no way of knowing how the body
acts on the mind, or the mind on the body. When we consider
the nature and attributes of body and of mind they seem to
be so different, and so unalike, that we can’t ﬁnd any handle
by which either can lay hold of the other. There is a deep
and dark gulf between them that our understanding can’t
pass, and how they correspond and interrelate is absolutely
unknown.

107

Inquiry into the Human Mind

Thomas Reid

6: Seeing

Experience teaches us that certain effects on the body
are constantly followed by certain sensations of the mind,
and that in the other direction certain states of the mind are
constantly followed by certain motions in the body; but we
don’t see the chain that connects these events. For all we
know, their connection may be purely a matter of a choice by
·God· our maker. Perhaps the same sensations could have
been connected with other effects or with other bodily organs.
Perhaps we might have been made in such a way as to taste
with our ﬁngers, smell with our ears, and hear through the
nose. Perhaps we could have been made in such a way that
we could have all the sensations and perceptions that we
do in fact have, without any effect at all being made on our
bodily organs.

Be all that as it may, if nature had given us nothing more
than effects on the body and corresponding sensations in
our minds, that would have made us sentient beings but
not percipient ones—·beings that sense but not ones that
perceive·. In that case we would never have been able to form
a •conception of any external object, far less a •belief in its
existence. Our sensations don’t at all resemble external
objects, and we can’t discover through our reason any
necessary connection between the existence of the sensation
and the existence of the object.

Perhaps we could have been made with a constitution
such that we had our present ·actual· perceptions connected
with different sensations. Perhaps we could have had the
perception of external objects without any effects on the
sense-organs and without any sensations. Or, lastly, the
perceptions we have could have been immediately connected
with the effects on our organs, without any sensations
coming into the process. This last seems really to be the
case in one instance, namely in our perception of the visible
shape of bodies, as I noted in section 8.

So nature’s way of bringing about sense-perception can
be thought of as a kind of drama, in which some things are
performed off-stage, and others are represented to the mind
in a succession of different scenes. The •effect that the object
has on the organ (either by immediate contact or through
some intervening medium) and the •effect on the nerves and
the brain happen off-stage, and the mind sees nothing of
either of them. But by the laws of the drama every such
effect is followed by sensation, which is the ﬁrst scene that
is shown to the mind; and this scene is quickly followed by
another, which is the perception of the object.

In this drama, nature is the actor and we are specta-
tors. We know nothing of the stage-machinery by means of
which every different effect on the organ, nerves and brain
exhibits its corresponding sensation; or of the machinery by
means of which each sensation exhibits its corresponding
perception. We are inspired with the sensation, and with the
corresponding perception, by means unknown. And because
the mind

•passes immediately from the sensation to the con-
ception of and belief in the object that we have in
perception

in the same way that it

•passes from signs to the things signiﬁed by them,

I have called our sensations ‘signs of external objects’, ﬁnding
no terms that express better the function that nature has
assigned to sensations in perception and the relation they
have to their corresponding objects.

There is no need for a sign to resemble what it signiﬁes,
and indeed no sensation can resemble any external object.
But two things are needed for us to know things by means
of signs.

(1) A real connection must be established, either by the
course of nature or by the will and decision of men, between

108

Inquiry into the Human Mind

Thomas Reid

6: Seeing

the sign and the thing signiﬁed. When they are connected
by the course of nature it is a natural sign; when by human
decision it is an artiﬁcial sign. Thus smoke is a natural sign
of ﬁre, certain facial expressions are natural signs of anger;
but our spoken or written words are artiﬁcial signs of our
thoughts and purposes.

(2) For us to know things by signs, the sign’s appearing
to the mind must be followed by the conception of and belief
in the thing signiﬁed. If this doesn’t happen the sign isn’t
understood or interpreted, in which case it isn’t to us a sign,
however suitable it may be in itself to serve as a sign.

Now, the mind passes from the appearance of a natural
sign to the conception of and belief in the thing signiﬁed in
three ways—by •original principles of our constitution, by
•custom, and by •reasoning.

Our •original perceptions are had in the ﬁrst of these
ways, our •acquired perceptions in the second, and
•everything that reason discovers concerning the course
of nature in the third.
In the ﬁrst of these ways, nature
through the sensations of touch informs us of the hardness
and softness of bodies, of their extension, shape and motion,
and of the space in which they move and are situated, as
I explained in chapter 5 above. And in the second of these
ways nature informs us by means of our eyes of almost all
the same things that originally we could perceive only by
touch.

In order to provide a better grasp of how we •learn to
perceive so many things •by the eye which •originally could
be perceived only •by touch, I should ﬁrst point out

the signs by which those things are exhibited to the
eye, and the connection between those signs and the
things signiﬁed by them;

and secondly consider

how the experience of this connection produces the
habit by which the mind passes, with no reasoning
or reﬂection, from the sign to the conception of and
belief in the thing signiﬁed.

·This all concerns ‘acquired perceptions’, the second of the
trio listed just under item (2) above. It will be my topic until
the end of section 23·.

Of all the acquired perceptions that we have by sight, the
most remarkable is the perception of the distance of objects
from the eyes. So I shall consider in some detail the signs
by which this perception is exhibited, and only make some
general remarks—·with much less detail·—concerning the
signs that are used in other acquired perceptions.

22. The signs by which we learn to perceive dis-
tance from the eye

I remarked earlier that the original perceptions of sight are
signs that serve to introduce the acquired ones; but this
doesn’t mean that no other signs are employed for that
purpose. For clear vision, many motions of the eyes have to
be varied according to how far away the object is; and such
motions, being connected by habit with the corresponding
distances of the object, become signs of those distances. The
motions in question were at ﬁrst made freely and deliberately;
but as nature’s intention was to produce perfect and clear
vision by means of them, we soon learn by experience to
regulate them according to that intention only, without even
thinking about it.

A ship requires a different trim [= ‘a different setting of the
sails’] for every variation in the direction and strength of the
wind; and—if I may be allowed to borrow that word—the eyes
require a different trim for every degree of light and for every
variation (within certain limits) in the distance of the object.

The eyes are trimmed for a particular object by contracting
certain muscles and relaxing others, as the ship is trimmed
for a particular wind by pulling some ropes and slackening
others. The sailor learns the trim of his ship, as we learn
the trim of our eyes, by experience. Although a ship is the
noblest machine that human skill can boast, it is far inferior
to the eye in this respect: it requires skill and ingenuity to
navigate a •ship; and a sailor must know which ropes to pull
and which to slacken to make her right for a particular wind;
whereas one needs no skill or ingenuity to see by the •eye,
because such superior wisdom has gone into its structure
and workings. Even the part of vision that is acquired by
experience is attained by idiots: we don’t need to know which
muscles to contract and which to relax to make the eye right
for a particular distance of the object. But although we
aren’t conscious of the motions we make in order to make
the eyes right for the distance of the object, we are conscious
of the effort involved in producing those motions; and they
are probably accompanied by some sensation that we don’t
attend to any more than we do to other sensations. And thus

•an effort consciously exerted, or
•a sensation resulting from that effort,

comes to be associated with

•the distance of the object that gave rise to it;

and this association enables the effort or the sensation to
become a sign of that distance. I shall give examples of this
when I come to discuss the means or signs by which we
learn to see how far objects are from the eye. I accept Dr.
Porterﬁeld’s list of these, despite our difference of opinion:
he thinks that distance from the eye is perceived •originally,
while I think it is perceived only •by experience.

In general, when a nearby object affects the eye in one way
and the same object when further off affects it in a different
way, these different states of the eye become signs of the

corresponding distances. So I can show how we perceive
distance by means of the eye by showing in what ways objects
affect the eye differently depending on how far away they are.
·I shall discuss ﬁve of them in this section·.

1. It is well known that to see objects clearly at various
distances, the shape of the eye must undergo some change.
And nature has given us the power to adapt our eye to nearby
objects by contracting certain muscles, and to distant objects
by contracting other muscles.

Anatomists don’t entirely agrees about how this is done
and what muscles are employed in it. The ingenious Dr.
Jurin, in his excellent essay on clear and blurred vision,
seems to have given the most likely account of this matter,
and I refer you to him.

Anyway,. . . .it is certain that young people generally have
the power to adapt their eyes to all distances of the object
from six or seven inches to ﬁfteen or sixteen feet, so as to
have perfect and clear vision at any distance within these
limits. It follows from this that what we consciously do to
adapt the eye to any particular object-distance within these
limits will be connected and associated with that distance
and will become a sign of it. When the object is moved
away beyond the furthest limit of clear vision, it will be seen
unclearly, but more or less so depending on whether its
distance is greater or less; so that the degrees of clarity of
the object can become the signs of distances considerably
beyond the furthest limit of distinct vision.
If this were
our only way of perceiving the distance of visible objects, the
most distant objects would appear to be no more than twenty
or thirty feet from the eye, and the tops of houses and trees
would seem to touch the clouds; for in that case the signs
of all greater distances would be the same, so they would
have the same signiﬁcation and would thus give the same
perception of distance.

110

Inquiry into the Human Mind

Thomas Reid

6: Seeing

Here is a more important point. When as children we
learn to perceive distance by the eye, the closest objects that
we learn to perceive clearly are about six or seven inches
away, and for that reason no object that is seen clearly ever
appears to be closer than six or seven inches from the eye.
We have devices for making a small object appear clearly
when it is in reality not more than half an inch from the eye—
either by using a single microscope, or by looking through a
small pinhole in a card. When an object is made to appear
clearly by either of these means, it seems to be at least six or
seven inches away— i.e. within the limits of ·unaided· clear
vision—however close it is in reality.

This observation gets extra importance from the fact that
it provides the only •reason we can give why an object is
magniﬁed either by a single microscope or by being seen
through a pinhole, and the only •means by which we can
determine by how much the microscope or pinhole will
magnify the object. Thus, if the object is really half an
inch away from the eye and appears to be seven inches away,
its diameter will seem to be enlarged in the same proportion
as its distance, i.e. fourteen times.

2. For us to direct both eyes to an object, the optic
axes must slope towards one another—more or less steeply,
depending on how near or distant the object is. We aren’t
conscious of this slope, but we are conscious of the effort
involved in creating it. This enables us to perceive things
that are very close to us more accurately than we could do
just by the shaping—·the ‘trim’·—of the eye. And so we ﬁnd
that people who have lost the sight of one eye are apt to
make mistakes about how far away objects are—even objects
within an arm’s length—these being mistakes that are easily
avoided by those who see with both eyes. Such mistakes
are often discovered in snufﬁng a candle, threading a needle,
or ﬁlling a tea-cup. When a picture is seen fairly close up

with both eyes, the representation doesn’t seem as natural
as when it is seen with only one. The intention of painting is
to deceive the eye, making things appear to be at different
distances when really they are on the same piece of canvas;
and it is harder to deceive two eyes in this way than to
deceive just one, because we perceive the distance of visible
objects more accurately and precisely with two eyes than
with one. If the shading and relief are carried out as well as
they can be, the picture can have

almost the same appearance to one eye as the objects
themselves would have,

but it can’t have

the same appearance to one eye as to two.

This isn’t the fault of the artist—it’s an unavoidable imper-
fection in painting as such. What makes the picture look
•better, close up, with one than with two is the very same
fact that makes a single eye •worse than two eyes at judging
distances and avoiding deception about them.

The biggest obstacle—and I think the only one that can’t
be overcome— to that agreeable deception of the eye that the
painter aims at is our perception of how far visible objects
are from the eye—a perception that we have partly through
•the shape of the eye but mainly through •the angle between
If this perception ·of distance· could be
the optic axes.
removed, I see no reason why a picture couldn’t be made so
perfect that it would really deceive the eye and be mistaken
for the original object. In order to judge the merit of a picture,
therefore, we ought as far as we can to exclude •those two
means of perceiving the distance from us of its different
parts.

In order to remove this perception of distance, art-lovers
use a good method:
they look at the picture with one
eye, through a tube that excludes the view of all the other
objects. This entirely excludes our main way of perceiving

111

Inquiry into the Human Mind

Thomas Reid

6: Seeing

the distance of the object, namely the angle between the
optic axes. I humbly suggest an improvement of this method
of viewing pictures, namely making the tube through which
one looks at the picture very narrow. If the aperture is as
small as a pinhole, so much the better, as long as there is
enough light to see the picture clearly. The reason for my
proposal is that when we look at an object through a small
aperture it is seen clearly, whether or not the shape of the
eye is adapted to its distance; and then our only remaining
way to estimate the distance is the light and colouring in the
picture, and those are up to the painter. So if he does his
part properly, the picture will affect the eye in the same way
that the object represented would do; which is the perfection
of his art.

Although the second way of perceiving the distance of
visible objects is more exact than the ﬁrst, there are limits
beyond which it is of no use. When the optic axes directed
to an object are so nearly parallel that in directing them to
an even more distant object we aren’t conscious of any new
effort and don’t have any different sensation, that is where
our perception of distance stops; all more distant objects
affect the eye in the same manner, so we perceive them to be
at the same distance. That is why the sun, moon, planets
and ﬁxed stars, when seen not near the horizon, appear
to be all at the same distance as though they were on the
inner surface of a great sphere. The surface of this heavenly
sphere is at the distance beyond which all objects affect the
eye in the same way. I shall explain later why this celestial
ceiling appears more distant toward the horizon.

3. When objects are far away, their ·apparent· colours
become fainter and more washed-out, and are tinged more
with the blue of the intervening atmosphere; also, their
small parts become less clear and their outline less precisely
marked out. It is mainly through these facts that painters

can represent objects ·as being· at very different distances,
on the same canvas. Simply making an object smaller
wouldn’t have the effect of making it appear to be far off
if there weren’t also this degradation of its colour, and the
unclarity of its outline and its small parts. If a painter made
one human ﬁgure a tenth of the size of other human ﬁgures
in the same picture, with the colours as bright and the
outline and minute parts as precisely marked, it wouldn’t
appear like a man at a great distance but rather like a pygmy
or Lilliputian. When an object has a variety of colours, its
distance is more clearly indicated by the gradual fusion of
the colours into one another than when it is of one uniform
colour.
In the steeple that stands before me at a small
distance, the joinings of the stones are clearly perceptible;
the grey colour of the stone is clearly marked off from the
white cement; when I see at a greater distance, the joinings of
the stones are less clear and the colours of the stone and of
the cement begin to fuse into one another; at a still distance
greater the joinings disappear altogether and the variety of
colour vanishes. [Reid then makes the same point in terms
of the appearances of colours and outlines as one backs
away from an apple tree. He concludes:] This change of
appearance, corresponding to the different distances, marks
the distance more exactly than if the whole object had been
of one colour.

Dr. Smith reports in his ·System of Optics· a fascinating
observation made by Bishop Berkeley in his travels through
Italy and Sicily. He observed that in those countries, cities
and palaces seen at a great distance appeared to him miles
nearer than they really were; and suggested this explanation:
the purity of the Italian and Sicilian air gave to very distant
objects the degree of brightness and clarity that was to be
seen only in nearby objects in the polluted air of his own
country. Italian painters commonly give a more lively colour

112

Inquiry into the Human Mind

6: Seeing

to the sky than the Flemish ones do, and this has been
attributed to the purity of the Italian air. Oughtn’t they
for the same reason to represent very distant objects with
brighter colours and more clear detail of the small parts?

Just as in uncommonly pure air we are apt to think
visible objects to be nearer and smaller than they really are,
so in uncommonly foggy air we are apt to think them more
distant and larger than they are. Walking by the seaside
in a thick fog I see an object that seems to me to be a man
on horseback about half a mile away. My companion, who
has better eyes or is more accustomed to seeing such things
in fog, assures me that it is a sea-gull. . . . On a second
look I immediately agree with him: it now appears to me to
be a sea-gull about seventy yards away. My mistake and
my correction of it are both so sudden that we don’t know
whether to call them ‘judgment’ or simple ‘perception’.

It isn’t worthwhile to argue about labels; but it is evident
that my ﬁrst belief and my second corrected one were pro-
duced by •signs rather than by •arguments, and that in each
of them my mind reached its conclusion by •habit and not by
•reasoning. The process of my mind seems to have been as
follows. Not knowing (or not bearing in mind) the effect of a
foggy air on the visible appearance of objects, •I perceive the
object as having the washed-outness of colour and fuzziness
of outline that objects ·customarily· have at a distance of
half a mile; taking that visible appearance as a sign, I
•immediately proceed to the belief that the object is half
a mile distant. Then that distance together with the visible
size •signify to me that the real size must be equal to that of
a man on horseback, and the ﬁgure—given the unclarity of
its outline— agrees with that of a man on horseback. Thus
the deception is brought about. But when I am assured
that it is a sea-gull, the real size of a seagull together with
the visible size presented to the eye immediately suggest the

distance, which in this case can’t be above seventy yards;
the unclarity of the ﬁgure likewise suggests the fogginess of
the air as its cause; and now the whole chain of signs and
things signiﬁed seems stronger and better connected than it
was before: the half mile shrinks to seventy yards, the man
on horseback dwindles to a sea-gull, I get a new perception,
and I wonder how I got the previous one or what has become
of it; for it has now so entirely gone that I can’t get it back.
I should add that in order to produce such deceptions
from the clearness or fogginess of the air, it must be un-
commonly clear or uncommonly foggy; for we learn from
experience to make allowance for the variety of air-conditions
that we have been accustomed to observe and that we
are aware of. So Bishop Berkeley made a mistake in his
explanation of why the moon appears larger near the horizon.
The cause of this, he said, is that near the horizon the
moon’s light is faint because it has passed though more of
the atmosphere ·than when it is higher in the sky·; but this
is wrong, because we are so used to seeing the moon with
different degrees of faintness and brightness that we learn to
make allowance for this, and aren’t led by the faintness of her
appearance to imagine her size as increased. Besides, it is
certain that when the moon near the horizon is seen through
a tube that cuts off the view of the intervening ground and
of all terrestrial objects, it loses all that unusual appearance
of size.

4. We frequently perceive the distance of objects by means
of intervening or contiguous objects whose distance or size
is already known. When I perceive certain ﬁelds. . . .to lie
between me and an object, it’s obvious that they can become
signs of its distance. Even if we don’t know exactly how
big the ﬁelds are, their similarity to others that we know
suggests their sizes. We are so used to measuring with our
eye the ground that we move across, and to comparing •the

113

Inquiry into the Human Mind

Thomas Reid

6: Seeing

judgments of distances formed by sight with •what we know
in other ways, that we gradually learn in this way to form a
more accurate judgment of the distance of terrestrial objects
than we could do by the means described earlier. An object
placed on the top of a high building appears much smaller
than when it is placed on the ground at the same distance.
When it stands on the ground

•the intervening ground serves as a sign of •its distance,
and •the distance together with •the visible size serves
as a sign of •its real size.

But when the object is placed high up this sign of its distance
is taken away; •the remaining signs lead us to place it at •a
lesser distance; and •this lesser distance together with •the
visible size becomes •a sign of a lesser real size. Methods 1
and 2 would never on their own make a visible object appear
to be more than about two hundred feet away, because
beyond that distance the shape of the eyes and the angle
between their axes don’t alter in any way that one could
feel. Method 3 is only a vague and approximate sign when
applied to distances greater than two or three hundred feet,
unless we know the real colour and shape of the object. And
method 5, which I shall come to shortly, can be applied only
to objects that are familiar, or whose real size is known. So
it follows that when unknown objects on or near the surface
of the earth are perceived to be some miles away, it is always
by this method 4 that we are led to that conclusion.

Dr. Smith has made the sound point that the known
distance of the most distant terrestrial objects that we see
makes •the part of the sky that is toward the horizon appear
more distant than •the part that is toward the zenith. So
the apparent shape of the sky is not that of •a hemisphere [=
‘half-sphere’] but rather of •a segment of a sphere that is less
than half of it. So, also, the diameter of the sun or moon, or
the distance between two ﬁxed stars, appears much greater

when seen contiguous to a hill or to any distant terrestrial
object than it appears when no terrestrial object is seen at
the same time.

These observations have been sufﬁciently explained and
conﬁrmed by Dr. Smith. Let me add that when the visible
horizon is terminated by very distant objects the sky seems
to be enlarged in all dimensions. When I view it from
a conﬁned street or lane it has some proportion to the
buildings that surround me; but when I view it from a large
plain, surrounded by hills that rise one above another to a
distance of twenty miles from the eye, I seem to see a new
heaven whose magniﬁcence declares the greatness of ·God·,
its author, and puts every human building to shame; for
now the lofty spires and gorgeous palaces shrink to nothing
before it, and are no more comparable with the celestial
dome than their makers are comparable with its maker!

5. Our only remaining way of perceiving the distance of
visible objects is by the lessening of their visible or apparent
size. By experience I know what a man (for example) looks
like at a distance of ten feet; I perceive the gradual and
proportional lessening of this visible ﬁgure at the distance
of twenty, forty, a hundred feet, and at greater distances
until it vanishes altogether. Thus, a certain visible size of
a known object becomes the sign of a certain determinate
distance, and brings with it the conception of and belief in
that distance.

In this process of the mind, the sign is not •a sensation
but rather •an original perception. We perceive the visible
shape and visible size of the object by the original powers of
vision; but the visible shape is used only as a sign of the real
shape, and the visible size is used only as a sign either of the
distance or of the real size of the object; and so these original
perceptions—like other mere signs - pass through the mind
without our attending to them or reﬂecting on them.

114

Inquiry into the Human Mind

Thomas Reid

6: Seeing

This last way of perceiving the distance of known ob-
jects serves to explain some very remarkable phenomena in
optics—ones that would otherwise appear very mysterious.
When we view an object of known size through a telescope,
there is no way of determining their distance except this
method 5. From this it follows that known objects seen
through a telescope must seem •to be brought nearer in
proportion to the magnifying power of the glass, or to be
moved to a greater distance in proportion to the minifying
power of the glass.

Suppose that a man who has never before seen objects
through a telescope is told that the telescope that he is about
to use magniﬁes the diameter of the object ten times. When
he looks through this telescope at a man six feet high, what
will he expect to see? Surely he will naturally expect to see a
giant sixty feet high. But he sees no such thing! The man
appears no more than six feet high, and consequently no
bigger than he really is; but he appears ten times nearer
than he is. The telescope indeed magniﬁes tenfold the image
of this man on the retina, and must therefore magnify his
visible ﬁgure in the same proportion; and as we have been
accustomed to seeing him with this visible size when—and
only when—he was ten times nearer than he is at present,
this visible size suggests the conception of and belief in
that distance of the object with which it has been always
connected. . . . That’s why a telescope seems not to magnify
known objects but to bring them nearer to the eye.

When we look through a pinhole or a single microscope at
an object that is half an inch from the eye, the picture of the
object on the retina is not enlarged but only clariﬁed; and the
visible ﬁgure isn’t enlarged either; yet the object appears to
the eye twelve or fourteen times more distant, and twelve or
fourteen larger in diameter, than it really is. A telescope such
as the one I have mentioned ampliﬁes the image on the retina,

and the visible ﬁgure of the object, ten times in diameter,
and yet makes it seem no bigger but only ten times nearer.
Writers on optics have known about these appearances for
a long time, and have struggled to explain them through
•optical principles; but they had no chance of succeeding.
The appearances must be explained in terms of •habits of
perception that are acquired by •custom, though they are
apt to be mistaken for •original perceptions. Berkeley ﬁrst
provided the world with the proper key for opening up these
mysterious appearances, but he made considerable mistakes
in his use of it. Dr. Smith, in his elaborate and judicious
treatise System of Optics, has applied it to the apparent
distance of objects seen through glasses, and to the apparent
shape of the sky, with such wonderful success that there is
now no room for doubt about the causes of these phenomena.

23. The signs used in other acquired perceptions

The most important thing to be learned in vision is the
distance of objects from the eye. Many others things are
easily learned on the basis of that.

•The distance of the object joined with •its visible size
is a sign of •its real size; and
•the distances of the object’s various parts joined with
•its visible shape is a sign of •its real shape.

Thus, when I look at a globe that stands before me, all I
perceive by the original powers of sight is something that
is circular and variously coloured. The visible ﬁgure has
no distance from the eye, isn’t convex, and has only two
dimensions; even its size is incapable of being measured
in inches, feet, or other linear measures. But when I have
learned to perceive the distance from the eye of each part of
this object, this perception gives it convexity and a spherical
shape, adding a third dimension to the two that it had before.

115

Inquiry into the Human Mind

Thomas Reid

6: Seeing

The distance of the whole object similarly makes me perceive
its real size. . . .

I showed in section 7 that the visible shape of a body can
be inferred by mathematical reasoning from its real shape,
distance and orientation in relation to the eye; similarly we
can, by mathematical reasoning infer from the visible shape,
together with the distances from the eye of the various parts
of it, infer the real shape and orientation. But this second
inference is usually made not by mathematical or any other
kind of reasoning, but by custom.

We have no name for the sensation that the original
appearance the colour of an object makes to the eye, be-
cause in everyday life we use it merely as a sign, and don’t
attend to it. But this appearance signiﬁes different things in
different circumstances. If a piece of cloth with one uniform
colour is placed partly in sunlight and partly in the shade,
the appearance of colour in these different parts is very
different; yet we perceive the colour to be the same because
we interpret the variety of appearance as •a sign of light and
shade and not as •a sign of real difference in colour. But if
our eye could be deceived into not perceiving the difference
of light on the two parts of the cloth, then we would interpret
the variety in the appearance to signify different colours in
the parts of the cloth.

If the cloth is placed as before, but with the shaded part
brighter in colour than the sunlit part, so that the two parts
give the same appearance to the eye, we’ll interpret the
•sameness of appearance as a sign of a •difference in colour,
because we’ll allow for the effect of light and shade.

When the •real colour of an object is known, its •apparent

colour indicates

the degree of light or shade, or
the colour of the nearby bodies whose rays it reﬂects, or
how far or near the object is (as I noted in section 22),

depending on the circumstances; and these can ·in their
turn· suggest other things to the mind. Thus, an unusual
appearance in the colour of familiar objects may lead to the
diagnosis of a disease in the spectator. The appearance of
things in my room may indicate sunshine or cloudy weather,
the earth covered with snow or blackened with rain. . . .

I have already remarked that •the original and acquired
perceptions that we have by our senses are •the language of
nature to man, which is similar in many respects to human
languages. My examples of acquired perceptions suggest this
point of resemblance: just as ambiguities are often found in
human languages, the language of nature in our acquired
perceptions has them too. We have seen this especially in
the case of vision, where the same appearance to the eye can
in different circumstances indicate different things. So when
the circumstances on which the interpretation of the signs
depends are unknown, the signs must be ambiguous; and
when the circumstances are mistaken, the meaning of the
signs must also be mistaken.

This is the case with all the phenomena that we call
‘fallacies of the senses’, and especially with those we call
‘fallacies of vision’. The appearance of things to the eye
always conforms to the ﬁxed laws of nature, so strictly
speaking there are no fallacies in the senses. Nature always
speaks the same language, and uses the same signs ·with
the same meanings· in the same circumstances; but we
sometimes mistake the meaning of a sign, either through
ignorance of the laws of nature or through ignorance of
the circumstances in which the sign has occurred. To
someone who doesn’t know the principles of optics, almost
every experiment made with a prism, a magic lantern, a
telescope or a microscope seems to produce some fallacy in
vision! Even the appearance of a common mirror would seem
most remarkably fallacious to someone who knew nothing

116

Inquiry into the Human Mind

Thomas Reid

6: Seeing

at all about how mirrors work. For how can a man be more
deceived than he is in seeing in front of him something that
is really behind him? In seeing himself several yards away
from himself? Yet children who haven’t yet learned to speak
learn not to be deceived by these appearances. These, as
well as all other surprising appearances produced by optical
glasses, are a part of the visual language; and to those who
understand the laws of nature concerning light and colours
they are in no way fallacious, but have a true and clear
meaning.

24. How perception is analogous to the trust we
have in human testimony

There are countless objects of human knowledge, but the
channels through which the knowledge is conveyed to the
mind are few. Among the important channels are these two:

the perception of external things by our senses, and
the information we get through human testimony.

The analogy between these two is so remarkable, as is the
analogy between the forces of the mind used by one and
those used by the other, that I shall without further apology
consider them together.

In the testimony of nature given by the senses, as well as
in human testimony given by language, things are signiﬁed
to us by signs; and in each of them the mind passes, either by
original forces or by custom, from the sign to the conception
of and belief in the things signiﬁed.

I have divided our perceptions into •original and
•acquired; and have divided language into •natural and
•artiﬁcial. There is a great analogy between •acquired per-
ception and •artiﬁcial language, but an even great analogy
between •original perception and •natural language.

In original perception the signs are sensations, of which
nature has given us a great variety, suited to the variety
of the things signiﬁed by them. Nature has established a
real connection between the signs and the things signiﬁed;
and nature has also taught us how to interpret the signs, so
that independently of experience the sign suggests the thing
signiﬁed and creates the belief in it.

In natural language the signs are features of the face,
gestures of the body and modulations of the voice; and the
variety of these is suited to the variety of the things signiﬁed
by them. Nature has established a real connection between
these signs and the thoughts and mental dispositions that
they signify; and nature has taught us how to interpret these
signs, so that independently of experience the sign suggests
the thing signiﬁed and creates the belief in it. A man on
a social occasion can, without doing good or evil, behave
himself

gracefully, civilly, politely,

or, on the contrary,

meanly, rudely and impertinently,

without uttering a word! We see the disposition of his mind
by their natural signs in his face and his behaviour, in the
same way that we perceive the shape and other qualities
of bodies by the sensations that nature has connected with
them.

The signs in the natural language of the human face and
behaviour, as well as the signs in our original perceptions,
have the same signiﬁcation [= ‘meaning’] in all climates and in
all nations, and the ability to interpret them is innate, not
acquired.

In acquired perception the signs are either •sensations
or •things that we perceive by means of sensations. The
connection between the sign and the thing signiﬁed is es-
tablished by nature, and we discover this connection by

117

Inquiry into the Human Mind

Thomas Reid

6: Seeing

experience—but helped in this by our original perceptions or
by previously acquired ones. After we have discovered this
connection, the sign always suggests the thing signiﬁed, and
creates the belief in it—just as with original perception.

In artiﬁcial language, the signs are articulate sounds that
are connected by human decision with the things signiﬁed
by them. In learning our mother tongue we discover this
connection by experience— but we’re helped in this by
natural language or by previously learned artiﬁcial language.
And after we have this connection, the sign always suggests
the thing signiﬁed, and creates the belief in it—just as with
natural language,

We don’t have many original perceptions compared with
the acquired ones, but without the former we couldn’t
possibly attain the latter. Similarly, natural language is
scanty compared with artiﬁcial language; but without the
former we couldn’t possibly attain the latter.

Our original perceptions, as well as the natural language
of human features and gestures, must be explained in terms
of the particular forces at work in the human constitution.
Thus it is by one of these that certain features express anger,
and by another that certain features express benevolence.
Similarly, it is because of one particular force of our consti-
tution that a certain sensation signiﬁes hardness in the body
that I handle, and it is by another that a certain sensation
signiﬁes motion in that body.

But •our acquired perceptions and •the information we
get through artiﬁcial language must be explained in terms
of general forces in the human constitution. When a painter
perceives that this picture is the work of Raphael and that the
work of Titian, a jeweller that this is a true diamond and that
a counterfeit, a sailor that this is a ship of ﬁve hundred tons
and that a ship of four hundred—these different acquired
perceptions are produced by the same general forces in

the human mind, which operate differently ·at different
times· in one person, depending on how he applies them,
and operate differently in different person, depending on
their various upbringings and ways of life. Similarly, when
certain articulate sounds convey to my mind the knowledge
of the battle of Pharsalia and to others the knowledge of the
battle of Poltowa, or when a Frenchman and an Englishman
receive the same information through different articulate
sounds, the signs used in these different cases produce, by
means of the same general forces in the human constitution.
the knowledge of and belief in the things signiﬁed. Now,
if we compare •the general forces in our constitution that
enable us to receive information from our fellow creatures by
language with •the general forces that enable us to acquire
the perception of things by our senses, we shall ﬁnd them to
be very similar in their nature and manner of operation.

When we begin to learn our mother tongue, we perceive
(through the help of natural language) that those who speak
to us use certain sounds to express certain things; we imitate
the same sounds when we want to express the same things,
and we ﬁnd that we are understood.

But here a difﬁculty occurs that we should attend to
because the solution of it leads to some original forces in
the human mind that are of great importance and of very
extensive inﬂuence. We know by experience that men have
used such-and-such words to express such-and-such things.
But all experience is of the past, and it can’t in itself give
any notion of or belief in what is future. So how do we come
to believe—and to rely conﬁdently on the belief—that men
who could do otherwise will continue to use the same words
when they think the same things? Where do we get it from,
this knowledge and belief (or, better, this foresight) of the
future voluntary actions of our fellow-creatures? Have they
promised that they will never deceive us by ambiguity or

118

Inquiry into the Human Mind

6: Seeing

falsehood? No, they have not. And even if they had, that
wouldn’t remove the difﬁculty, for such a promise would
have to be expressed by words or by other signs, and we
couldn’t rely on it unless we were assured that they were
giving the usual meanings to the signs expressing promise.
No sensible person ever thought of taking a man’s own word
for his honesty: when we rely on someone’s word or promise,
we are obviously already taking his truthfulness for granted.
Anyway, this reliance on the declarations and testimony
of men is found in children long before they know what a
promise is.

So there is in the human mind an early expectation,
not derived from •experience or from •reason or from any
•contract or promise, that when our fellow-creatures use
language they will use the same signs when they have the
same thoughts.

This is in reality a kind of foreknowledge of human ac-
tions; and it seems to me to be an original force in the human
constitution, without which we couldn’t have language and
so couldn’t receive instruction.

The wise and beneﬁcent author of nature, who intended
•that we should be social creatures and •that we should
receive the largest and most important part of our knowledge
through information from others, has for these purposes
implanted in our natures two forces that ﬁt in with one
other.

1. The ﬁrst is a propensity to speak the truth, and to use
the signs of language so as to convey our real thoughts. This
operates powerfully, even in the greatest liars; for even they
speak truth a hundred times for every lie they tell. Truth is
always uppermost, and is the natural output of the mind. It
requires no skill or training, no inducement or temptation;
to be truthful all we need do is to yield to a natural impulse.
Lying on the other hand is doing violence to our nature; and

even the worst men never do it without some temptation.
•Speaking truth is like •eating our natural food, which our
appetite would lead us to do even if it didn’t lead to any
·desired· end ·such as preserving health·; but •lying is like
•taking medicine, which tastes disgusting and which no-one
takes except for some end that he can’t otherwise achieve.

You may want to object: ‘Men can be inﬂuenced by moral
or political considerations to speak the truth, so their doing
so is no proof of an original force such as you have men-
tioned.’ I answer ﬁrst •that moral or political considerations
can’t come into play until we arrive at years of understanding
and reﬂection; yet we know from experience that children
invariably keep to the truth before they are capable of being
inﬂuenced by such considerations. And secondly •that when
we are inﬂuenced by moral or political considerations, we
must be aware of that inﬂuence and capable of perceiving
it on reﬂection. Now, when I reﬂect on my actions most
attentively I am not aware that in speaking the truth I am
inﬂuenced on ordinary occasions by any moral or political
motive. I ﬁnd that truth is always at the door of my lips,
and goes out spontaneously if I don’t hold it back. For
truth to come out, it isn’t necessary for me to have any good
or bad intention; all that is needed is for me to be simple,
straightforward, not up to anything. It may well be that some
•temptations to falsehood would be too strong for the natural
force of •truthfulness unless forces of •honour or virtue were
bought to its aid; but when there is no such temptation we
speak the truth by instinct; and this instinct is the force I
have been explaining.

By this instinct, a real connection is formed between our
words and our thoughts—one that makes the former ﬁt to
be signs of the latter, which they couldn’t otherwise be. This
connection is broken every time someone lies or trades on
ambiguity; but cases of this are comparatively rare, so the

119

Inquiry into the Human Mind

Thomas Reid

6: Seeing

authority of human testimony is only weakened by them, not
destroyed.

2. A second original force implanted in us by ·God·, the
supreme being, is a disposition to trust in the truthfulness
of others and to believe what they tell us. Let the ﬁrst of
the two forces be called ‘the force for truthfulness’; then this
second one—the counterpart of the ﬁrst—can be called ‘the
force for trust’. It is unlimited in children until they meet
with instances of deceit and falsehood, and it stays pretty
strong throughout life.

If nature had left the mind of the speaker evenly balanced
between truth and falsehood, children would lie as often
as they spoke the truth, until their •reason had developed
far enough to suggest that lying is •imprudent, or their
•conscience had developed far enough to suggest that lying
is •immoral.
[Reid wrote ‘as often as they speak the truth’, making
lying much commoner than truth-telling. This was presumably a slip.]
And if nature had left the mind of the hearer evenly balanced
between believing and disbelieving what is said, we wouldn’t
take anyone’s word until we had positive evidence that
he was speaking the truth.
In those circumstances his
testimony would have no more authority than his dreams -
which may be true or false, but no-one is inclined to believe
them just because they were dreamed! It is obvious that in
the matter of testimony nature tips the balance of human
judgment to the side of belief; that is the side our judgment
takes when there is nothing put into the opposite scale. If
this were not so, no proposition that is uttered in discourse
would be believed until it was examined and tested by reason,
and most men would be unable to ﬁnd reasons for believing
a thousandth part of what is told to them. Such distrust and
disbelief would deprive us of the greatest beneﬁts of society
and make our condition worse than that of savages.

On this supposition ·of equilibrium between belief and dis-
belief·, •children would be absolutely untrusting and there-
fore absolutely unteachable; •those ·adults· who had little
knowledge of human life and of the manners and characters
of men would be in the next degree untrusting; and the most
trusting people would be •those with the greatest experience
and deepest thought, because they would often be able to
ﬁnd good reasons for believing the testimony—reasons that
the weak and the ignorant couldn’t discover.

In short: •if trust were the effect of reasoning and expe-
rience, it would grow up and gather strength in the same
proportion as reason and experience do. But •if it is a gift
of nature, it will be strongest in childhood and limited and
restrained by experience. You don’t have to know much
about human life to realise that the second of these is really
the case, and not the ﬁrst.

Nature intends that we should be carried in the arms
of others before we can walk on our legs; similarly, nature
intends that our belief should be guided by the authority and
reason of others before it can be guided by our own reason.
The weakness of the infant and the natural affection of the
mother plainly indicate the former of these; and the natural
trustfulness of youth and the authority of age equally plainly
indicate the latter. The infant, by proper nursing and care,
acquires strength to walk without support. Reason likewise
has her infancy when she must be carried in arms; at that
time she leans entirely on authority, by natural instinct, as
if she were conscious of her own weakness; and without this
support she becomes dizzy. When brought to maturity by
proper development she begins to feel her own strength and
to lean less on the reason of others; she learns to suspect
testimony in some cases and to disbelieve it in others, and
she sets limits to that authority to which she was at ﬁrst
entirely subject. But still, throughout her life she ﬁnds that

120

Inquiry into the Human Mind

Thomas Reid

6: Seeing

•she has to borrow light from testimony when she has no
light of her own ·to shine on the matter in question·, and
that •she has to lean somewhat on the reason of others when
she is conscious of her own weakness.

Just as reason, even in her maturity, often gets help
from testimony, so she also sometimes gives help back to
testimony and strengthens its authority. For just as we ﬁnd
good reason to reject testimony in some cases, so in others
we ﬁnd good reason to rely on it with perfect conﬁdence in
our most important concerns.

The witnesses are trustworthy people. There are many
of them. They have nothing personally at stake in this
matter. They can’t have come together to agree on
their testimony. It’s not credible that the agreement
of their testimony came about by chance.

These facts may give an irresistible strength to testimony,
compared with which its native and intrinsic authority is
very inconsiderable.

Having now considered the general forces in the human
mind that enable us to receive information from our fellow-
creatures by means of language, let us next consider the gen-
eral forces that enable us to receive information about nature
through our own acquired perceptions. It is undeniable—and
nobody does deny—that when we have found two things to be
constantly conjoined in the course of nature, the appearance
of one of them is immediately followed by the conception of
and belief in the other. The former becomes a natural sign of
the latter; and the knowledge of their constant conjunction
in the past, whether acquired by experience or in some
other way, is sufﬁcient to make us rely conﬁdently on the
continuance of that conjunction.

This process of the human mind is so familiar that we
never think of inquiring into the forces that underlie it. We
are apt to conceive it as a self-evident truth that what is

to come must be similar to what is past. Thus if a certain
degree of cold freezes water today and has been known to
do so throughout the past, we have no doubt that the same
degree of cold will freeze water tomorrow or a year hence. I
freely grant that this is a truth that all men believe as soon
as they understand it, but my question is: What makes it
evident to us? Not the relating of ideas, surely; for when
I set the idea of •cold alongside that of •water hardened
into a transparent solid body, I can perceive no connection
between them; no-one can show one to be a necessary effect
of the other, or give a shadow of reason why nature has
conjoined them. But don’t we learn their conjunction from
experience? True; experience informs us that they have
been conjoined in the past; but no-one has ever had any
experience of what is future, and that’s our question—How
do we come to believe that the future will be like the past?
Has the author of nature promised this? Or were we told
about his planning at the time when he established the
present laws of nature and settled how long they were to
continue for? No, surely. Indeed, if we believe that there is a
wise and good author of nature, we can see a good reason
why he should give a long lease of life to the same laws of
nature and the same connections of things. The reason is
that if he did otherwise we couldn’t learn anything from what
is past, and all our experience would be useless to us. But
though this consideration can when we come to the use of
reason conﬁrm our belief in the continuance of the present
course of nature, it can’t have given rise to this belief ·in the
ﬁrst place·, for children and idiots have this belief as soon as
they know that ﬁre will burn them. So it must be an effect of
instinct, not of reason.

The wise author of our nature intended that a great
and necessary part of our knowledge should be derived
from experience before we are capable of reasoning, and

121

Inquiry into the Human Mind

Thomas Reid

6: Seeing

he has provided means that are perfectly adequate to this
intention. (1) God governs nature by ﬁxed laws, so that we
ﬁnd innumerable connections of things that continue from
age to age. Without this stability in the course of nature
there could be no experience, or ·there would be experience
but· it would be a false guide and lead us into error and
trouble. If there were no force for truthfulness in the human
mind, men’s words wouldn’t be signs of their thoughts; and
if there were no regularity in the course of nature, no one
thing could be a natural sign of something else. (2) God has
implanted in human minds an original force which leads
us to believe in and expect the continuance of the course
of nature and of the connections that we have observed in
the past. It is through this general force in our nature that
when two things have been found connected in the past the
appearance of one produces a belief in the other.

I think that the ingenious author of the Treatise of Human
Nature, ·David Hume·, was the ﬁrst to point out that our
belief in the continuance of the laws of nature can’t be
founded either on knowledge or probability; but, far from
conceiving it to be an original force in the mind, he tries
to explain it in terms of his favourite hypothesis, namely
that belief is nothing but a certain degree of liveliness in
the idea of the thing that is believed. I made one remark on
this curious hypothesis in chapter 2, and now I shall make
another.

•The belief we have in perception is a belief in the
present existence of the object.
•The belief we have in memory is a belief in the object’s
past existence.
•The belief I am now discussing is a belief in the object’s
future existence, and
•In imagination there is no belief at all.

What I want Hume to tell me is this: How does it come about
that one degree of liveliness ties the existence of the object to
•the present moment, another carries it back to •a past time,
a third goes the opposite way and carries it into •the future,
and a fourth carries it •out of existence altogether? Suppose
I see the sun rising out of the sea; I remember having seen
it rise yesterday; I believe it will rise tomorrow near the
same place; I can likewise imagine it rising in that place,
without any belief at all. Now, according to ·Hume’s· sceptical
hypothesis, this perception, this memory, this foreknowledge
and this imagination are all the same idea, varied only by
different degrees of liveliness: the perception of the sun rising
is the liveliest idea, the memory of its rising yesterday is the
same idea a little fainter, the belief in its rising tomorrow
is the same idea fainter still; and the imagination of its
rising is still the same idea but faintest of all. One would
have thought that this idea might gradually pass through
all possible degrees of liveliness without stirring out of its
position ·in time·; but if we do think this we deceive ourselves
(according to Hume), for as soon at the idea begin to grow
faint it moves backward into the past. Well, if we grant this,
we would at least expect that. . . .the •more its liveliness fades
the •further back in time it will go, until it recedes out of
sight. But here we are deceived again (according to Hume),
for at a certain point in this declining liveliness the idea,
as if it had met an elastic obstacle in its backward motion,
suddenly rebounds from the •past to the •future without
touching on the •present en route. And now that the idea
has come into the regions of futurity, we might expect that
the future gives it room enough to spend all its remaining
vigour; but yet again we are deceived (according to Hume),
because the idea makes another vigorous jump up into the
airy region of imagination. . . . This article of the sceptical
creed is so full of mystery. . . .that it appears to require as

122

Inquiry into the Human Mind

Thomas Reid

6: Seeing

much faith as does the Athanasian Creed!

However, I agree with Hume that our belief in the contin-
uance of nature’s law is not derived from reason. It is an
instinctive foreknowledge of the operations of nature, very
like the foreknowledge of human actions that makes us rely
on the testimony of our fellow creatures; and just as we need
the latter if we are to be able to receive information from men
by language, so we need the former if we are to be able to
receive information about nature by means of experience.

All our knowledge of nature beyond our original per-
ceptions is acquired by experience, and consists in the
interpretation of natural signs. The constancy of nature’s
laws connects the sign with the thing signiﬁed, and, by the
natural force I have just explained we rely on the continuance
of the connections that experience has revealed; and thus
the appearance of the sign is followed by the belief in the
thing signiﬁed.

This aspect of the workings of our constitution is the
basis not only for acquired perception but for all inductive
reasoning and all our reasoning from analogy; so, for want
of another name, let me call it the ‘inductive force’.
It is
what leads us to assent immediately to the axiom on which
all our knowledge of nature is built, namely that effects of
the same kind must have the same cause. For ‘effects’ and
‘causes’ in the operations of nature mean nothing but ‘signs’
and ‘things signiﬁed by them’. We don’t perceive in any
natural cause any real causality or effectiveness, but only
a connection established in the course of nature between
it and what is called its ‘effect’. Our constitution makes
us expect, independently of all reasoning, that there is a
ﬁxed and steady course of nature; and we have an eager
desire to discover it. We pay attention to every conjunction
of things that presents itself, and expect that conjunction
to continue. And when such a conjunction has been often

observed, we think of the things as naturally connected, and
the appearance of one carries along with it the belief in the
other, without any reasoning or reﬂection ·on our part·.

If you think that the inductive force can be explained in
terms of what philosophers usually call the ‘association of
ideas’, you should bear in mind that this force associates a
natural sign are not only with an idea but with a belief in the
thing signiﬁed. This can’t properly be called an ‘association
of ideas’ unless ideas and belief are one and the same thing.
A child has found the prick of a pin conjoined with pain, so
now he believes and knows that these things are naturally
connected; he knows that the one will always follow the other.
If you want to call this only an ‘association of ideas’ I don’t
want to argue about words, but I think you are speaking
very improperly. For if we express it in plain English, it is a
foreknowledge that things you have found conjoined in the
past will be conjoined in the future. And this foreknowledge
is an effect not of reasoning but of an original force in human
nature, which I have called the ‘inductive force’.

This force, like the force for trust, is unlimited in infancy
and is gradually restrained and regulated as we grow up. It
leads us often into mistakes, but on the whole it is inﬁnitely
helpful to us. By the inductive force

(1) a child who has once been burnt keeps away from the

ﬁre, and

(2) a child who has once been inoculated runs away from

the surgeon who did it.

It is better that he should do (2) than that he should not do
(1). But the mistakes we are led into by these two natural
forces are of different kinds. Men sometimes lead us into
mistakes when we perfectly understand their language, by
speaking lies. But nature never misleads us in this way; her
language is always true, and it is only by misinterpreting
it that we fall into error. There must be many •accidental

123

Inquiry into the Human Mind

Thomas Reid

6: Seeing

conjunctions of things, as well as •natural connections; and
•the former are apt to be mistaken for •the latter. Thus
in example (2) the child connected the pain of inoculation
with the surgeon, whereas it was really connected only with
the needle’s going in. Philosophers and men of science also
make such mistakes; indeed all false reasoning in philosophy
comes from them. •False reasoning is drawn from experience
and analogy just as •sound reasoning is; if it weren’t, it
wouldn’t be plausible; but the difference between them is
that between •an unskilful and rash interpretation of natural
signs and •a sound and legitimate interpretation of them. If
a child or an educated man were told to interpret a book of
science, written in his mother tongue, how many blunders
and mistakes would he be apt to fall into? Yet he knows as
much of this language as he needs for his manner of life.

The language of nature is what we all study, and the
students of it belong to different classes. •Brutes, idiots and
children engage in this study, and owe to it all their acquired
perceptions. •Ordinary not very educated men make more
progress with it, and learn through a little thought many
things that children don’t know. •Philosophers [here = ‘scien-
tists’] ﬁll up the top class in this school, and are scholars
of the language of nature. All these different classes have
one teacher, Experience, enlightened by the inductive force.
Take away the light of this inductive force and Experience is
as blind as a mole; she may indeed feel what is present and
what immediately touches her, but she sees nothing that is
spatially or temporally separated from her.

The rules of inductive reasoning, i.e. of a sound inter-
pretation of nature, as well as the fallacies by which we are
apt to misinterpret her language, have been brilliantly set
out by the great genius of Francis Bacon; so that his New
Organon can fairly be called ‘a grammar of the language of
nature’. It adds greatly to the merit of this work, and excuses

its defects, that at the time Bacon wrote it the world had
not seen any tolerable model of inductive reasoning from
which the rules of such reasoning might be copied. The arts
of poetry and eloquence had grown up to perfection when
Aristotle described them; but the art of interpreting nature
was still an embryo when Bacon described the features and
proportions it would have as an adult. Aristotle drew his
rules ·for poetry etc.· from models of those arts that are still
the best that have appeared; but the best models of inductive
reasoning that have appeared, which I take to be the third
book of Newton’s Principia and his Optics, were drawn from
Bacon’s rules! The purpose of all those rules is to teach us
to distinguish seeming or apparent connections of things in
the course of nature from ones that are real.

Those who are unskilful in inductive reasoning are more
likely to fall into error in their •reasonings from the phenom-
ena of nature than in their •acquired perceptions. This is
because we often •reason from a few instances, and thus
risk mistaking accidental conjunctions of events for natural
connections; whereas the •habit of passing without reasoning
from the sign to the thing signiﬁed, which is what acquired
perception is, has to be learned through many instances
or experiments; and the number of experiments serves not
only to conﬁrm our belief in natural connections but also to
disconnect the events that have been accidentally conjoined.
From the time that children begin to use their hands,
nature directs them to handle everything over and over,
to look at it while they handle it, and to put it in various
postures and at various distances from the eye. We are
apt to excuse this as something that children do because
they have to be doing something and haven’t the mental
resources to entertain themselves in a more grown-up way.
But if we think more justly we’ll ﬁnd that they are engaged
in a most serious and important study, and if they had all

124

Inquiry into the Human Mind

Thomas Reid

6: Seeing

the reason of a philosopher they couldn’t be better employed.
For it is this childish conduct that enables them to make
proper use of their eyes. Through it they every day acquire
habits of perception that are of greater importance than
anything we could teach them. The original perceptions that
nature gave them are few, and insufﬁcient for the purposes
of life; so she made them capable of acquiring many more
perceptions by habit. And to complete her work she has
made children tireless in conducting the exercises by which
those perceptions are acquired.

This is the education that nature gives to her children.
And while I am on this topic I might as well add that another
part of nature’s education is that in the natural course of
things children often can’t gratify their curiosity and satisfy
their appetites without exerting all their muscular force
and employing all their ingenuity. What they want can
be obtained only at the expense of labour and patience and
many disappointments. By the exercise of body and mind
necessary for satisfying their desires, they acquire agility,
strength and dexterity in their motions, as well as health
and vigour in their constitutions; they learn patience and
perseverance; they learn to take pain in a good spirit and to
bear up under disappointment. Nature’s education is most
perfect in savages, who have no other tutor; and we see that
in

the acuteness of all their senses,
the agility of their motions,
the hardiness of their constitutions, and
the strength of their minds to bear hunger, thirst, pain

and disappointment,

savages commonly far exceed civilized people. This seems to
be what has led a very able writer to prefer the savage life to
that of society. But nature’s education, unaided, could never
produce a Rousseau! Nature intends that human education

should be added to her régime in order to form the man. And
she has equipped us for human education by the natural
forces for imitation and for trust, which reveal themselves
almost in infancy, as well as by others that develop later.

When the education we receive from men doesn’t give
scope to nature’s education, it is wrongly directed; it tends to
hurt our faculties of perception, and to weaken both the body
and mind. Nature has her way of rearing men, as she has her
way of curing their diseases. •The art of medicine is to follow
nature, imitating her and helping her to cure the diseases;
and •the art of education is to follow nature, helping and
imitating her in her way of rearing men. In ancient times
the inhabitants of the Balearic Islands followed nature in
teaching their children to be good archers: they hung their
dinner up high by a thread, and left the youngsters to bring
it down by their skill in archery!

The education of nature, with the addition only of such
human care as is needed to preserve life, makes a perfect
savage. Human education added to that of nature can make
a good citizen, a skillful artisan, or a well bred man. But
to produce a Rousseau, a Bacon or a Newton there must
be tutoring ·not only from nature and from men, but also·
from reason and reﬂection. Despite the innumerable errors
committed in human education, hardly any education is so
bad that it’s worse than having none. And I think that even
Rousseau, if he had to choose whether to educate a son
among the French, the Italians, the Chinese or the Eskimos,
wouldn’t choose the Eskimos.

When reason is properly employed it will conﬁrm the
documents of nature, which are always true and wholesome;
and it will distinguish the good from the bad among the
documents of human education, rejecting the bad with
modesty [here = ‘without making a big fuss’] and holding onto
the good with reverence.

Chapter 7: Conclusion

Chapter 7: Conclusion

Reﬂections on the opinions of philosophers on this
subject

There are two ways in which men can form their notions
and opinions about the mind, and about its powers and
operations. The •ﬁrst is the only way that leads to truth,
but it is narrow and rough, and few have entered on it.
The •second is broad and smooth, and has been much
travelled—not only by the vulgar but even by philosophers. It
is sufﬁcient for everyday life and is suitable for the purposes
of the poet and orator, but in philosophical investigations of
the mind it leads to error and delusion.

We may call the •ﬁrst of these ways the way of reﬂection.
When the mind is at work we are conscious of its workings;
it is in our power to attend to them and reﬂect on them
until they become familiar objects of thought. This is our
only way of forming sound and accurate notions of those
mental operations. But this attention and reﬂection is so
hard for us, surrounded as we are by external objects that
constantly claim our attention, that it has been very little
practised, even by philosophers. Many times in the course
of this Inquiry I have had reason to remark on how little
attention has been given to the most familiar operations of
the senses.

The •second, and the most common, way in which men
form their opinions about the mind and its operations may be
called the way of analogy. There is nothing in the course of
nature that is so special that we can’t ﬁnd some resemblance,
or at least some analogy, between it and other things with
which we are acquainted. The mind naturally delights
in hunting after such analogies, and it attends to them

with pleasure. From them poetry and wit derive a great
part of their charms, and eloquence gets a good deal of its
persuasive force from them. Besides the pleasure we receive
from analogies, they are of very considerable use, both in
•helping us to think about things that we can’t easily get
hold of without that handle, and in •leading us to probable
conjectures about the nature and qualities of things that
we haven’t the means to investigate more directly. When I
consider that the planet Jupiter is like the earth in this:

it rotates around its own axis, revolves around the
sun, and is lit up by several secondary planets as the
earth is lit up the moon,

I am inclined to conjecture from analogy that, as these
features of the earth ﬁt it to be the habitation of various
orders of animals, they also make the planet Jupiter ﬁt to
contain animals; and having no more direct and conclusive
argument to settle the matter, I accept the conclusion of this
analogical reasoning, with a degree of assent proportioned
to its strength. When I observe that the potato plant very
much resembles the solanum in its ﬂower and fruit, and am
informed that the solanum is poisonous, I am inclined from
analogy to have some suspicion of the potato; but in this
case I have access to more direct and certain evidence, and
therefore ought not to trust to analogy, which would lead me
into an error.

•Arguments from analogy are always easily available,
and crop up spontaneously in a fruitful imagination; but
•arguments that are more direct and more conclusive often
require painful attention and concentration; which is why
mankind in general have been strongly inclined to trust to
•the former. Look carefully at the systems of the ancient

127

Inquiry into the Human Mind

Chapter 7: Conclusion

philosophers, either concerning the material world or con-
cerning the mind, and you’ll ﬁnd them to be built solely on
the foundation of analogy. Francis Bacon ﬁrst described
the strict and severe method of induction; since his time it
has been applied with great success in some parts of natural
philosophy and very little in anything else. There is in fact no
subject in which mankind are so strongly inclined to trust to
the analogical way of thinking and reasoning as they are in
what concerns the mind and its workings; because forming
clear and distinct notions of those workings in the direct
and proper way, and reasoning about them, requires a habit
of attentive reﬂection of which few people are capable, and
of which no-one is capable without much trouble and hard
work.

Every man is apt to form his notions of things that
are unfamiliar or hard to grasp from their analogy with
things that are more familiar. Thus, if a sailor. . . .were to
start theorizing about the powers of the mind, he would no
doubt. . . .ﬁnd in the mind sails, masts, rudder, and compass!
Sensible objects of one kind or another occupy and
engross the rest of mankind as much as ship-related things
occupy the sailor. For much of our lives we can think of
nothing but the objects of sense; and it is hard, even after we
come to years of reﬂection, to attend to things of a different
kind in such a way as to form clear and distinct notions of
them. So the condition of mankind provides good reason
to expect •that their language and their common notions
relating to the mind and its operations will be analogical, and
derived from the objects of sense; and •that these analogies
will be apt to deceive philosophers as well as on the vulgar,
leading them to materialize the mind and its faculties. And
experience abundantly conﬁrms the truth of this expectation.
The names given to the soul in almost all languages
sufﬁciently testify to how generally men of all nations at all

times have conceived the soul or generator of thoughts in
man to be some subtle matter, like breath or wind, We have
words that are proper [= ‘literally and strictly correct’], and not
analogical, to express the various ways in which we perceive
external objects by the senses—words such as ‘feeling’, ‘sight’
and ‘taste’—but we are often obliged to use these words
analogically, to express other powers of the mind that are
of a very different nature, ·for instance when we talk about
‘seeing that there is something wrong with his argument’.
And for the powers that involve some degree of reﬂection we
generally have only analogical names. The objects of thought
are said to be

•in the mind, ·though the mind is not spatial·,
•weighed, ·though mental items have no weight·,
•apprehended—·from Latin apprehendere = ‘seize’·,
•comprehended—·from comprehendere = ‘seize’·,
•conceived—·from concipere = ‘contain’ or ‘grasp’·
•imagined—·from imago = ‘picture’ or ‘image’·,
•retained—·from retinere = ‘hold back’·,
•ruminated—·from ruminare = ‘chew the cud’·.

The notions that the ancient philosophers had regarding the
nature of the soul don’t appear to have been much more
reﬁned than those of the vulgar, or to have been formed in
any other way. I shall distinguish philosophical positions
regarding the soul into the ‘old and the ‘new’. •The old is
now almost extinct: it lasted until the time of Descartes, who
gave it a fatal blow from which it has been slowly dying ever
since. Descartes is the father of •the new philosophy of the
soul, but it has been gradually improving since his time, on
principles laid down by him. The old philosophy seems to
have been purely analogical; the new is derived more from
reﬂection, but still with a very considerable mixture of the
old analogical notions.

128

Inquiry into the Human Mind

Thomas Reid

Chapter 7: Conclusion

Because the objects of sense consist of matter and form,
the ancient philosophers thought that everything must be-
long to one of these categories or to be made up of both.
Thus, some thought that the soul is a particular kind of
subtle [= ‘very ﬁnely divided’] matter, separable from our gross
[= ‘lumpy’] bodies; others thought that it is only a particular
form of the body, and inseparable from it. For it seems that
some of the ancients, like some of the moderns, thought that
a certain structure or organization ·or form· of the body is all
that is necessary to make it capable of sensing and thinking.
These philosophers thought that the different powers of the
mind belong to different parts of the body—e.g. the heart,
the brain, the liver, the stomach, the blood.

Those who thought that the soul is a subtle matter
separable from the body argued about which of the ‘four
elements’ it belongs to, whether to earth, water, air, or ﬁre.
Each of these except earth had its particular advocates. But
some thought that it involves all the elements: something
in its make-up must be similar to everything we perceive
(they argued), and we perceive earth by the earthly part of
the soul, water by its watery part, and ﬁre by its ﬁery part.
Some philosophers wanted to know not just what kind of
matter the soul is made of but also what its shape is; and
they decided that it is spherical, so as to be more ﬁt for
motion. Among the ancient philosophers the most spiritual
and sublime notion concerning the nature of the soul was
that of the Platonists, I think. They held that the soul is
made of the same •heavenly and •incorruptible matter that
the ﬁxed stars were made of, and therefore has a natural
tendency to ·ﬂy upwards to· rejoin its proper element. I can’t
work out which of these classes of philosophers Aristotle
belonged to. He deﬁnes the soul to be the ﬁrst entelekheia
·of a natural body that has potential life. Forgive me for not
translating the Greek word—I don’t know what it means!

[‘In Aristotle’s use: the essential nature or informing principle of a living
thing; the soul’—New Shorter Oxford English Dictionary.]

The ancient philosophers’ notions of the operations of
the mind, particularly with regard to perceptions and ideas,
seem also to have been formed by the same kind of analogy.
Of the philosophers whose writings we have, Plato was
the ﬁrst to introduce the word ‘idea’ into philosophy, but his
doctrine of ideas was somewhat peculiar. He agreed with the
other ancient philosophers that all things consist of matter
and form; and that

the matter of which all things are made exists from
eternity, without form;

but he also believed that

there are eternal forms of all possible things, and
these exist without matter;

and to these eternal and immaterial forms he gave the
name ‘ideas’, maintaining that they are the only objects
of true knowledge. It doesn’t matter much to us whether he
borrowed these notions from Parmenides or whether they
came from his own creative imagination. The later Platonists
seem to have improved on them: they conceived those ideas
or eternal forms of things to exist not of themselves but in the
mind of God, and to be the models and patterns according
to which all things were made. . . .

Malebranche’s views are close to these Platonic notions.
He seems to have been more aware than anyone else of the
difﬁculties that come with the common hypothesis concern-
ing ideas, namely that ideas of all objects of thought are in
the human mind. To avoid those difﬁculties, Malebranche
contends that •the ideas that are the immediate objects of
human thought are •the ideas of things in the mind of God;
because God is intimately present to every human mind, he
can reveal his ideas to it as far as he pleases.

129

Inquiry into the Human Mind

Thomas Reid

Chapter 7: Conclusion

Apart from the Platonists and Malebranche, every philoso-
pher that I know of has thought that there are ideas or
images of every object of thought in the human •mind, or at
least in some part of the •brain where the mind is supposed
to have its residence.

Aristotle had no great liking for the word ‘idea’, and
seldom or never uses it except when refuting Plato’s notions
about ideas. He thought that matter can exist without form,
but that forms can’t exist without matter—·i.e. that for a form
to exist there must be something that has it·. But at the
same time he taught •that there can be no sensing, imagining
or thinking without forms, phantasms or species in the mind;
and •that things that can be sensed are perceived by ‘sensible
species’, while things that can be thought are perceived by
‘intelligible species’. His followers went into more detail.
They held that those sensible and intelligible species are
•emitted by the objects, and •make their impressions on the
passive intellect; and that the active intellect perceives those
impressions. This seems to have been the common opinion
while the Aristotelian philosophy retained its authority.

The Epicurean doctrine, as explained by Lucretius,
though widely different from the Aristotelian one in many
things, is almost the same in this. He afﬁrms that slender
ﬁlms or ghosts, tenuia rerum simulacra [= ‘ﬁne, delicate copies of
things’] go on being emitted from all things and ﬂying about;
and that these, being extremely subtle, easily penetrate our
gross bodies, strike on the mind, and thus cause thought
and imagination.

After the Aristotelian system had reigned for more than a
thousand years in the colleges of Europe, almost without a
rival, it sank when it ran up against the system of Descartes.
The clarity of his writings and notions, contrasted with the
obscurity of Aristotle and his commentators, created a strong
prejudice in favour of his new philosophy. The characteristic

of Plato’s genius was •sublimity, that of Aristotle’s •subtlety;
but Descartes far excelled both in •clarity, and he bequeathed
this spirit to his successors. The theory about the mind
and its workings that is now generally accepted gets from
Descartes not only its •spirit but its •basic principles; and
even after all the improvements made by Malebranche, Locke,
Berkeley and Hume, it can still be called ‘the Cartesian
system’. So I shall make some remarks about its spirit
and tendency in general, and about its doctrine of ideas in
particular. ·There will be ﬁve of these; they will bring us to
the end of this book·.

1. The method that Descartes pursued naturally led him
to attend more to the operations of the mind by accurate
reﬂection, and to trust less to analogical reasoning on this
subject, than any philosopher had done before him. Intend-
ing to build a system on a new foundation, he began with
a resolve to admit nothing that wasn’t absolutely certain
and evident. He supposed that his senses, his memory,
his reason and every other faculty to which we trust in
common life might be deceptive; and he resolved to disbelieve
everything, until he was compelled by irresistible everything
to assent ·to something·.

What appeared to him ﬁrst of all to be certain and evident
was •That he thought, that he doubted, that he deliberated.
In short, he held that the workings of his own mind, of
which he was conscious, must be real and not illusory; and
that even if all his other faculties were to deceive him, his
consciousness could not. So he looked on •this as the ﬁrst
of all truths. This was the ﬁrst ﬁrm ground on which he set
his foot after being tossed around in the ocean of scepticism;
and he resolved to build all knowledge on it without looking
for any more ﬁrst principles.

This would involve him in starting with what he knew by
consciousness and rigorously deducing from that every other

130

Inquiry into the Human Mind

Thomas Reid

Chapter 7: Conclusion

truth, and particularly the existence of the objects of sense;
so he was naturally led to attend to the ·mental· operations
of which he was conscious, without ·analogically· borrowing
his notions of them from external things.

It wasn’t analogical thinking but attentive reﬂection that

led Descartes to this conclusion:

of body, whereas the Cartesian drew his notions of the
qualities of body from his sensations.

The Aristotelian, taking it for granted that bodies and
their qualities really do exist and are such as we commonly
take them to be, inferred from them the nature of his
sensations, and reasoned in this manner:

Thought, volition, memory and the other attributes
of the mind are altogether unlike extension, shape,
and all the attributes of body; so we have no reason
to regard •thinking substances as having any resem-
blance to •extended substances; and as the attributes
of the thinking substance are things of which we are
conscious, we can have a more certain and immediate
knowledge of them by reﬂection than we can have of
external objects by our senses.

As far as I know, Descartes was the ﬁrst to make these
observations; and they are more important and more illumi-
nating than everything that had previously been said on this
subject. They ought to make us suspicious of—and nervous
about accepting—any notion concerning the mind and its
operations that is drawn by analogy from sensible objects,
and to make us rely only on accurate reﬂection as the source
of all real knowledge on this subject.

2. I observe that just as the Aristotelian system tends
to materialize the mind and its operations, so the Cartesian
system tends to spiritualize body and its qualities. The two
systems share a single error which leads •through analogy
to the ﬁrst of these extremes and •through reﬂection to the
second of them. The error I mean is the view that we can’t
know anything about body or its qualities except by having
sensations that resemble those qualities. The two systems
agreed in this, but according to their different methods of
reasoning they drew very different conclusions from it. The
Aristotelian drew his notions of sensation from the qualities

Our sensations are the impressions that sensible
objects make on the mind, and can be compared to
the impression of a seal on wax; the impression is the
likeness or form of the seal without the matter of it;
similarly, every sensation is the likeness or form of
some sensible quality of the object.

This is the reasoning of Aristotle, and it has an obvious
tendency to materialize the mind and its sensations.

The Cartesian, on the other hand, thinks that the exis-
tence of the body or of any of its qualities is not to be taken
as a ﬁrst principle, and that we oughtn’t to admit anything
about it except what can by valid reasoning be deduced from
our sensations. And he knows that by reﬂection we can
form clear and distinct notions of our sensations without
borrowing our notions of them by analogy from the objects
of the senses. So the Cartesians, beginning by attending
to their sensations, ﬁrst discovered that the sensations
corresponding to secondary qualities can’t resemble any
quality of body. From this Descartes and Locke inferred
that sound, taste, smell, colour, heat and cold, which the
vulgar took to be qualities of body, were not qualities of
body but mere sensations of the mind. Afterwards the
ingenious Berkeley paid closer attention to the nature of
sensation in general, and discovered and demonstrated that
no sensation whatever could possibly resemble any quality
of an unthinking being such as body is supposed to be; from
which he inferred, quite validly, that there is the same reason
to hold that extension, shape, and all the primary qualities

131

Inquiry into the Human Mind

Thomas Reid

Chapter 7: Conclusion

are mere sensations as there is to hold that the secondary
qualities are mere sensations. Thus, by valid reasoning
from the Cartesian principles matter was stripped of all its
qualities; the new system. . . .converted all the qualities of
matter into sensations, thus spiritualizing body, as the old
system had materialized spirit.

The way to avoid both these extremes is to admit •the
existence of what we see and feel as a ﬁrst principle, as well
as •the existence of things of which we are conscious; and
(with the Aristotelians) to take our notions of the qualities
of body from the testimony of our senses, and (with the
Cartesians) take our notions of our sensations from the
testimony of consciousness.

3. Modern scepticism is the natural offspring of the
new system; and although the system didn’t give birth to
this monster until the year 1739 ·when Hume’s Treatise of
Human Nature was published·, it can be said to have carried
it in its womb from the beginning.

The old system accepted all the principles of common
sense as ﬁrst principles, without requiring any proof of them;
and therefore, though its reasoning was commonly vague,
analogical and dark, it was built on a broad foundation and
had no tendency to scepticism. I don’t ﬁnd any Aristotelian
thinking he ought to prove the existence of a material world;
but every writer on the Cartesian system tried to do this, until
Berkeley clearly demonstrated the futility of their arguments,
from which he concluded that there is no such thing as a
material world and that the belief in it ought to be rejected
as a vulgar error.

The Cartesian system accepts only one of the principles
of common sense as a starting-point, and claims to deduce
all the rest from it by strict argumentation. The accepted
starting-point is the thesis that our thoughts, our sensations
and everything of which we are conscious has a real exis-

tence; and everything else must be made evident by the
light of reason. Reason must erect the whole structure of
knowledge on ·the foundation of· this single principle of
consciousness.

There is a disposition in human nature to bring things
down to as few principles as possible; and having very few
principles certainly adds to the beauty of a system if the
principles can take the weight that is placed on them. The
mathematicians are entitled to glory in having raised so
noble and magniﬁcent a system of science on the foundation
of a few axioms and deﬁnitions. ·But· this •love of simplicity,
of basing everything on a few principles, has produced many
a false system, and there never was any system in which
•it appears so remarkably as that of Descartes. His whole
system concerning matter and spirit is built on one axiom,
expressed in one word, Cogito [= ‘I think’]. On the foundation
of conscious thought, with ideas for his materials, he builds
his system of the human understanding and tries to account
for all its phenomena; and having (he thought) proved from
his consciousness the existence •of matter and •of a certain
quantity of motion originally conferred on it, he builds his
system of the material world and tries to account for all its
phenomena.

These principles concerning the material system have
been found to be inadequate.
It has become clear that
besides •matter and motion we must also admit •gravitation,
•cohesion and •corpuscular attraction, •magnetism, and
other •centripetal and •centrifugal forces by which the
particles of matter attract and repel each other. Newton
discovered this, demonstrating that these forces don’t come
down to matter and motion; and he was led by analogy and
the love of simplicity to conjecture—·not dogmatically, but·
with his characteristic modesty and caution—that all the
phenomena of the material world depend on •attracting and

132

Inquiry into the Human Mind

Thomas Reid

Chapter 7: Conclusion

•repelling forces in the particles of matter. But I venture to
say that this conjecture fell short of the mark. For even in
the inorganic kingdom the powers by which salts, crystals,
spars and many other bodies come together into regular
forms can never be accounted for by forces of attraction and
repulsion in the particles of matter. And in the plant and
animal kingdoms there are strong indications of powers of a
different nature from all the powers of inorganic bodies. So
we see that although in the structure of the material world
there is certainly all the beautiful simplicity consistent with
the purposes for which it was made, it isn’t as simple as the
•great Descartes said it is; indeed, it isn’t as simple as the
•greater Newton modestly conjectured it to be. Both were
misled by analogy, and the love of simplicity. Descartes
had had a great deal to do with extension, shape, and
motion; Newton had enlarged his views to take in attracting
and repelling forces; and both formed their notions of the
unknown parts of nature from those with which they were
acquainted—. . . .thus engaging in analogical thinking.

But to come to Descartes’s system concerning the human
understanding: as I have already noted, it was built on
consciousness as its sole foundation and with ideas as
its materials; and all Descartes’s followers have built on
the same foundation and with the same materials. They
acknowledge that nature has given us various •simple ideas.
These are analogous to the •matter of Descartes’s physical
system. They also acknowledge a •natural power by which
ideas are compounded, disjoined, associated, compared.
This is analogous to the •original quantity of motion in
Descartes’s physical system. From these starting-points they
try to explain the phenomena of the human understanding,
just as in the physical system the phenomena of nature were
to be explained by matter and motion. It must indeed be
acknowledged, that there is great simplicity in this system

as well as in the other. They are alike to an extent that might
be expected in children of the same father; one of them has
been found to be the child of Descartes rather than of nature,
so there is reason to think that Descartes fathered the other
one as well.

It is obvious that the natural outcome of this system is
scepticism with regard to everything except the existence of
our ideas and of the necessary relations amongst them that
appear when we compare them: because from

•ideas are the only objects of thought, and
•ideas have no existence except when we are conscious
of them,

it necessarily follows that

•no object of our thought can have a continued and
permanent existence.

We have been accustomed to regarding body and mind, cause
and effect, time and space, as existing independently of our
thought; but they are all turned out of existence by this short
dilemma:

Either these things are ideas of sensation or reﬂection,

or they are not;

if they are, they can can’t exist except when we are

conscious of them;

if they are not, they are words without any meaning.

Neither Descartes nor Locke perceived this consequence of
their system concerning ideas. Bishop Berkeley was the
ﬁrst who discovered it. And what followed on this discovery?
Why, •with regard to the material world and with regard
to space and time he accepts the conclusion that these
things are mere ideas, and have no existence except in our
minds; but •with regard to the existence of spirits or minds
he does not accept that conclusion—and if he had done so
he would have been an absolute sceptic. But how does he
evade this conclusion with regard to the existence of spirits?

133

Inquiry into the Human Mind

Thomas Reid

Chapter 7: Conclusion

The expedient that the good bishop uses on this occasion is
very remarkable, and shows his great dislike for scepticism.
He maintains •that we have no ideas of spirits, and •that
we can think and speak and reason about them and their
attributes without having any ideas of them. If this is so,
my lord bishop, what is to prevent us from thinking and
reasoning about bodies and their qualities without having
ideas of them? The bishop either didn’t think of this question
or didn’t think ﬁt to give any answer to it. However, I would
point out that in order to avoid scepticism Berkeley openly
jumps away from the Cartesian system, without giving any
reason why he does so in this instance and in no other.
This indeed is the only case of a deviation from Cartesian
principles that I have met with in Descartes’s successors;
and it seems to have been only a sudden lurch caused by a
terror of scepticism, for in everything else Berkeley’s system
is founded on Cartesian principles.

Thus we see, that Descartes and Locke take the road
that leads to scepticism, without knowing the end of it;
but they stop short for lack of light to take them further.
Berkeley, frightened at the appearance of the dreadful abyss
·of scepticism·, abruptly turns aside and avoids it. But Hume
is more daring and intrepid: without turning aside to the
right hand or to the left, like Virgil’s Alecto, he shoots directly
into the gulf. [Reid then quotes three Latin lines by Virgil.]
4. The new system gives an extremely lame and imperfect
account of the part of the furniture of the human under-
standing that is the gift of nature rather than being acquired
by our own reasoning faculty.

The natural furniture of the human understanding is of

two kinds:

the •notions or simple apprehensions that we have of

things, and

the •judgments or beliefs that we have concerning them.

The new system puts all our notions into two classes: •ideas
of sensation, which are taken to be copies of our sensations
that are retained in the memory or imagination; •ideas of
reﬂection, which are taken to be copies of the workings of
our minds of which we are conscious, similarly retained
in the memory or imagination. We are told that these two
classes include all the materials about which human beings
do or can think. As to our judgment of things, or the beliefs
that we have concerning them, the new system allows no
part of them to be the gift of nature, but regards them all
as acquired by reason through comparing our ideas and
perceiving their ‘agreements’ or ‘disagreements’. I regard this
account as extremely imperfect, both in what it says about
our notions and in its treatment of our judgments or beliefs.
I shall brieﬂy point out some of its main defects.

The division of our notions into ideas of sensation and
ideas of reﬂection is contrary to all rules of logic, because the
second member of the division includes the ﬁrst. We can’t
form clear and sound notions of our sensations in any way
except by reﬂection.

Sensation is an operation of the mind of which we
are conscious; and we get the notion of sensation by
reﬂecting on what we are conscious of.

Similarly,

doubting and believing are operations of the mind of
which we are conscious, and we get the notion of them
by reﬂecting on what we are conscious of.

So the ideas of sensation are ideas of reﬂection, as much
as the ideas of doubting or believing, or any other ideas
whatsoever.

Apart from its logical inaccuracy, this division ·of our no-
tions or ideas· is extremely incomplete. For, since sensation
is as much an operation of the mind as any of the other
things of which we form our notions by reﬂection, when

134

Inquiry into the Human Mind

Thomas Reid

Chapter 7: Conclusion

we are told ‘All our notions are either ideas of sensation
or ideas of reﬂection’, what this means in plain English is:
‘Human beings don’t and can’t think of anything except the
operations of their own minds.’ Nothing can be more contrary
to truth, or more contrary to the experience of mankind. I
know that Locke, while he maintained this doctrine, believed
that our notions of body and of its qualities, and of motion
and of space, are ideas of sensation. But why did he believe
this? It was because he believed those notions to be nothing
but images [= ‘likenesses’] of our sensations. Well, then, if in
fact the notions of body and its qualities, of motion and of
space are not likenesses of our sensations, won’t it follow
that those notions are not ideas of sensation? It certainly
will.

No doctrine in the new system leads more directly to
scepticism than this. And Hume knew very well how to use
it for that purpose; for if you maintain that there is any
such existing thing as body or mind, time or place, cause
or effect, he immediately catches you between the horns
of this dilemma: your notions of these things are either
ideas of sensation or ideas of reﬂection; if of sensation, from
what sensation are they copied? if of reﬂection, from what
operations of the mind are they copied?

It is indeed to be wished that those who have written
much about sensation and the other operations of the mind
had also carefully thought and reﬂected much on those oper-
ations! But isn’t it very strange that they won’t allow it to be
possible for mankind to think of anything else?

This system’s account of our judgment and beliefs about
things is as far from the truth as its account of our notions
or simple apprehensions. It represents our senses as having
no role except to provide the mind with notions or simple
apprehensions of things; and it says that our judgment
and belief about those things are acquired by relating our

notions to one another and perceiving their agreements or
disagreements.

I have shown, on the contrary, that every operation of
the senses includes judgment or belief as well as simple
apprehension. Thus, when I feel the pain of gout in my toe, I
have not only a •notion of pain but a •belief in its existence
and a •belief in something wrong in my toe that is causing
it. And this belief isn’t produced by inter-relating ideas
and perceiving their agreements and disagreements; it is
included in the very nature of the sensation. When I perceive
a tree in front of me, my faculty of seeing gives me not only
a •notion or simple apprehension of the tree, but a •belief
in its existence, its shape, its distance and its size; and this
judgment or belief is not acquired by comparing ideas—it is
included in the very nature of the perception. I have already
called attention to several original forces for belief in the
course of this Inquiry; and when other faculties of the mind
are examined we shall ﬁnd others that haven’t come up in
the examination of the ﬁve senses. Such original and natural
judgments are therefore a part of the provision nature has
made for the human understanding. Just as much as our
notions or simple apprehensions, they are put into our minds
by God. They serve to direct us in the everyday affairs of life,
where our reasoning faculty would leave us in the dark. They
are a part of our constitution, and all the discoveries of our
reason are based on them. They make up what is called ‘the
common sense of mankind’; and what is plainly contrary to
any of them is what we call ‘absurd’. Their strength is ‘good
sense’, which is often found in people who are not highly
intelligent. A remarkable deviation from them, arising from a
disorder in the person’s constitution, is what we call ‘lunacy’,
as when a man believes that he is made of glass. When a
man allows himself to be reasoned out of the principles of
common sense by metaphysical arguments, we may call this

135

Inquiry into the Human Mind

Thomas Reid

Chapter 7: Conclusion

‘metaphysical lunacy’, which differs from the other sort of
lunacy in being intermittent rather than continuous: it is apt
to seize the patient in solitary and speculative moments; but
when he comes into the company of others common sense
recovers its authority. A clear listing and explanation of the
principles of common sense is one of the chief things that
logic should provide. I have considered only the ones that
came up in the examination of the ﬁve senses.

5. Although the new system professes to set out on the
route of reﬂection, not that of analogy, it has retained some
of the old analogical notions concerning the workings of the
mind, particularly this one:

Things that don’t now exist in the mind itself can
only be perceived, remembered or imagined by means
of ideas or likenesses of them in the mind, which
are the immediate objects of perception, memory and
imagination.

This doctrine seems evidently to be borrowed from the old
·Aristotelian· system, which taught that external things
make impressions on the mind like the impressions of a
seal on wax; that it is by means of those impressions that
we perceive, remember or imagine them; and that those
impressions must resemble the things from which they are
taken. When we form our notions of the operations of the
mind by analogy, this way of conceiving them seems to be
very natural, and offers itself to our thoughts. Everything
that is ·tactually· felt must make some impression on the
body, and so we are apt to think that everything that is
understood must make some impression on the mind.

This analogical sort of reasoning seems to be the source of
the opinion—so universally accepted among philosophers—
that there are ideas or images of things in the mind. I have
pointed out that Berkeley at one point deserts this principle
of the new system by afﬁrming that we have no ideas of

spirits, and that we can think of them immediately, without
ideas. But I don’t know whether anyone has followed him
in this. The modern philosophers also somewhat disagree
amongst themselves regarding the ideas or images by which
(they say) we perceive, remember or imagine sensible things.
They all agree about the existence of such images, but they
differ about where they are: some say they are in a particular
part of the •brain where the soul is thought to reside, while
others place them in the •mind itself. Descartes held the
ﬁrst of these opinions, and Newton seems to have favoured
it also. . . . But Locke seems to place the ideas of sensible
things in the mind, and it is obvious that Berkeley and
Hume were of the same opinion. Hume makes a very curious
application of this doctrine, by trying to prove from it that
the mind is either an extended and divisible substance or
not a substance at all, because the ideas of extension can’t
be in a subject that is indivisible and unextended.

In this as in most things, Hume’s reasoning is admittedly

clear and strong. For whether ‘the idea of extension’ is

only another name for extension itself,

as Berkeley and Hume assert, or

an image and resemblance of extension,

as Locke thought—either way, any man of common sense will
agree that the idea of extension cannot be in an unextended
and indivisible subject. But while I agree with Hume in his
reasoning, I would make a different application of it. He takes
it for granted that there are ideas of extension in the mind,
from which he infers that if the mind is a substance at all it
must be an extended and divisible one. I on the other hand
take it for granted on the testimony of •common sense that
my mind is a substance, i.e. a permanent subject of thought;
and my •reason convinces me that it is an unextended and
indivisible substance; and from this I infer that there can’t
be anything in it that resembles extension. If this reasoning

Inquiry into the Human Mind

Thomas Reid

Chapter 7: Conclusion

had occurred to Berkeley, it would probably have led him to
accept that we can think and reason not only about spirits
but also about bodies without having ideas of them in the
mind.

I had intended to examine more fully and in more detail
this doctrine that there are ideas or images of things in the
mind; and also another doctrine that is based on it, namely
that judgment or belief is nothing but a perception of the
agreement or disagreement of our ideas. But all through
this work I have shown that the operations of the mind that
I have examined do not favour either of these doctrines, and
in many things contradict them; so I have thought it right to
drop this part of my plan. If there is any need for it, it can
be done better after inquiring into some other powers of the
human understanding.

Although I have examined only the ﬁve senses, and the
forces in the human mind that •are active in them or •have
come to our notice in the course of this examination, I shan’t
push on further with this inquiry until I have thought some
more. The powers of

memory,
imagination,
taste,
reasoning,
moral perception,
the will,
the passions,

the affections, and
all the active powers of the soul

present a vast and boundless ﬁeld of philosophical inquiry,
which I am far from thinking myself able to survey with ac-
curacy. Many able authors, ancient and modern, have made
excursions into this vast territory and have communicated
useful observations; but there is reason to believe that those
who have claimed to give us a map of the whole territory have
satisﬁed themselves with a very inaccurate and incomplete
survey of it.
If Galileo had attempted a complete system
of natural philosophy, he would probably have done little
service to mankind; but by conﬁning himself to what he could
understand, he laid the foundation for a system of knowledge
that is coming into existence gradually, and that does honour
to the human understanding. Newton, building on this
foundation and in the same way conﬁning his inquiries to
the law of gravitation and the properties of light, performed
wonders. If he had attempted a great deal more he would
have done a great deal less, and perhaps nothing at all. I
have wanted to follow these great examples—though with
shorter strides, alas! and with less force—so I have attempted
an inquiry into just one little corner of the human mind.
It seems to be the corner that is most exposed to vulgar
observation and is most easily comprehended; but if I have
described it accurately, you must admit that the accounts
previously given of it were very lame and wide of the truth.
