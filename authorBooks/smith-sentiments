with feelings at one end and opinions at the other. This work of his is strongly tilted in the ‘feeling’ direction [see

Sympathy

Part I: The Propriety of Action

Section 1: The Sense of Propriety

Chapter 1: Sympathy

No matter how selﬁsh you think man is, it’s obvious that
there are some principles [here = ‘drives’, ‘sources of energy’; see
note on page 164] in his nature that give him an interest in the
welfare of others, and make their happiness necessary to
him, even if he gets nothing from it but the pleasure of seeing
it. That’s what is involved in pity or compassion, the emotion
we feel for the misery of others, when we see it or are made
to think about it in a vivid way. The sorrow of others often
makes us sad—that’s an obvious matter of fact that doesn’t
need to be argued for by giving examples. This sentiment,
like all the other basic passions of human nature, is not
conﬁned to virtuous and humane people, though they may
feel it more intensely than others do. The greatest rufﬁan,
the most hardened criminal, has something of it.

We have ·of course· no immediate experience of what
other men feel; so the only way we can get an idea of what
someone else is feeling is by thinking about what we would
feel if we were in his situation. . . . Our imagination comes
into this, but only by representing to us the feelings we would
have if etc. We see or think about a man being tortured on the
rack; we think of ourselves enduring all the same torments,
entering into his body (so to speak) and becoming in a way
the same person as he is. In this manner we form some idea
of his sensations, and even feel something that somewhat
resembles them, though it is less intense. When his agonies
are brought home to us in this way, when we have adopted
them and made them our own, they start to affect us and we

then tremble and shudder at the thought of what he feels.
Just as being in pain or distress of any kind arouses the
most excessive sorrow, so conceiving or imagining being in
pain or distress arouses some degree of the same emotion,
the degree being large or small depending on how lively or
dull the conception is. [Notice Smith’s talk of ‘bringing home to us’
someone’s emotional state; he often uses that turn of phrase to express
the idea of imaginatively putting oneself in someone else’s position.]

So my thesis is that our fellow-feeling for the misery of
others comes from our imaginatively changing places with
the sufferer, thereby coming to •conceive what he feels or
even to •feel what he feels.
If this doesn’t seem to you
obvious enough, just as it stands, there is plenty of empirical
evidence for it. When we see someone poised to smash a
stick down on the leg or arm of another person, we naturally
shrink and pull back our own leg or arm; and when the stick
connects, we feel it in some measure, and are hurt by it
along with the sufferer. When a crowd are gazing at a dancer
on a slack rope, they naturally writhe and twist and balance
their own bodies, as they see him do, and as they feel they
would have to do if they were up on the rope where he is. . . .
Men notice that when they look at sore eyes they often feel
soreness in their own eyes. . . .

It’s not only in situations of pain or sorrow that this
fellow-feeling of ours is evoked. When someone has any
passion about any object, the thought of his situation cre-
ates an analogous emotion in the breast of every attentive
spectator. [In Smith’s day it was normal to use ‘the breast’ to mean
something like ‘the emotional part or aspect of the person’.
It will be

Sympathy

retained sometimes in this version, always with that meaning.] Our joy
over the deliverance of the heroes of tragedy or romance
is as sincere as our grief for their distress. . . . We enter
into their gratitude towards the faithful friends who stayed
with them in their difﬁculties; and we heartily go along with
their resentment against the perﬁdious traitors who injured,
abandoned, or deceived them. [The phrase ‘go along with’, though
it sounds late modern, is Smith’s; he uses it about 30 times in this work.]
In every passion of which the mind of man is capable, the
emotions of the bystander always correspond to what he
imagines must be the feelings of the sufferer, which he does
by bringing the case home to himself, ·i.e. imagining being
himself in the sufferer’s situation·.

‘Pity’ and ‘compassion’ are labels for our fellow-feeling
with the sorrow of others. ‘Sympathy’, though its meaning
may originally have been the same, can now fairly properly be
used to denote our fellow-feeling with any passion whatever.
[Since Smith’s time, ‘sympathy’ has moved back to what he says was its
original meaning: we don’t say ‘She had great sympathy for his joy’. In
the present version the word will be retained; his broadened meaning for
it needs to be remembered.]

We sometimes see sympathy arise merely from the view of
a certain emotion in another person: the passions sometimes
seem to be passed from one man to another instantaneously,
without the second man’s having any knowledge of what
aroused them in the ﬁrst man. When grief or joy, for example,
are strongly expressed in someone’s look and gestures, they
immediately affect the spectator with some degree of a similar
painful or agreeable emotion. A smiling face is a cheerful
object to everyone who sees it, and a sorrowful face is a
melancholy one.

But this doesn’t hold for every passion. There are some
passions the expressions of which arouse no sort of sym-
pathy; they serve rather to disgust and provoke us against

them, before we know what gave rise to them. The furious
behaviour of an angry man is more likely to exasperate us
against •him than against •his enemies. Because we don’t
know what provoked him, we can’t bring his case home to
ourselves, imaginatively putting ourselves in his position.
But we can put ourselves in the position of those with whom
he is angry; we can see what violence they may be exposed to
from such an enraged adversary. So we readily sympathize
with their fear or resentment, and are immediately inclined
to side with them against the man from whom they appear
to be in so much danger.

·There’s a very general point underlying the difference
between our reaction to someone else’s grief or joy and
our reaction to someone’s rage·. The mere appearances
of grief or joy inspire us with some level of a similar emotion,
because they suggest to us the general idea of some good
or bad fortune that has come to the person in whom we
observe them; and with grief and joy this is sufﬁcient to
have some little inﬂuence on us. Grief and joy don’t have
effects that go beyond •the person who has the grief or joy;
expressions of those passions don’t suggest to us—in the way
that expressions of resentment do—the idea of some other
person for whom we are concerned and whose interests are
opposite to •his. So the general idea of good or bad fortune
creates some concern for the person who has met with it,
but the general idea of provocation arouses no sympathy
with the anger of the man who has been provoked. It seems
that nature teaches us •to be more averse to entering into
this passion and •to be inclined to take sides against it until
we are informed of its cause.

Even our sympathy with someone else’s grief or joy is
incomplete until we know the cause of his state. General
lamentations that express nothing but the anguish of the
sufferer don’t cause in us any •actual strongly-felt sympathy;

2

Smith on Moral Sentiments

Sympathy

what they do is to make us want to inquire into the person’s
situation, and to make us •disposed to sympathize with him.
The ﬁrst question we ask is ‘What has happened?’ Until this
is answered, our fellow-feeling is not very considerable. We
do feel unhappy, ·but that is from sources different from
sympathy; it is· because of the vague idea we have of his
misfortune, and still more from our torturing ourselves with
guesses about what the source of his misery may be.

So the main source of sympathy is not the view of the
other person’s passion but rather the situation that arouses
the passion. Sometimes we feel for someone else a pas-
sion that he ·doesn’t have and· apparently isn’t capable
of having; because that passion arises in •our breast just
from •imagining ourselves as being in his situation, though
it doesn’t arise in •his breast from •really being in that
situation. When we blush for someone’s impudence and
rudeness, though he seems to have no sense of how badly
he is behaving, that is because we can’t help feeling how
utterly embarrassed we would be if we had behaved in such
an absurd manner.

Of all the calamities to which mankind can be subject,
the loss of reason appears to be by far the most dreadful, in
the mind of anyone who has the least spark of humanity. We
behold that last stage of human wretchedness with deeper
pity than any other. But the poor wretch who is in that
condition may laugh and sing, having no sense of his own
misery. The anguish that the rest of us feel at the sight
of such a person can’t be a reﬂection of any sentiment
that he has. The spectator’s compassion must arise purely
from the thought of what he himself would feel if he were
reduced to that same unhappy condition while also (this may
well be impossible) regarding it with his present reason and
judgment.

What are the pangs of a mother when she hears the
moanings of her infant who can’t express what it feels during
the agony of disease? In her idea of what it suffers, she
brings together

•her child’s real helplessness,
•her own consciousness of that helplessness, and
•her own terrors for the unknown consequences of the
child’s illness,

and out of all these she forms, for her own sorrow, the
most complete image of misery and distress.
[The phrase
‘for her own sorrow’ is Smith’s, as is ‘for our own misery’ in the next
paragraph.] But the infant feels only the unpleasantness of
the present instant, which can never be great. With regard
to the future, the infant is perfectly secure.
Its lack of
thoughtfulness and of foresight gives it an antidote against
•fear and •anxiety—those great tormentors of the human
breast, from which reason and philosophy will in vain try to
defend the child when it grows up to be a man.

We sympathize even with the dead. Ignoring what is of
real importance in their situation, namely the awe-inspiring
question of what future is in store for them ·in the after-life·,
we are mainly affected by factors that strike our senses but
can’t have any inﬂuence on their happiness. It is miserable,
we think, to be deprived of the light of the sun; to be shut out
from life and conversation; to be laid in the cold grave, a prey
to corruption and worms; to be no more thought of in this
world, but to be quite soon obliterated from the affections,
and almost from the memory, of their dearest friends and
relatives. Surely, we imagine, we can never feel too much for
those who have suffered such dreadful calamity! The tribute
of our fellow-feeling seems to be doubly due to them now,
when they are in danger of being forgotten by everyone; and
in paying vain honours to their memory we are trying, for our
own misery, artiﬁcially to keep alive our sad remembrance

3

Smith on Moral Sentiments

Pleasure of mutual sympathy

of their misfortune. The fact that our sympathy can’t bring
them any consolation seems to add to their calamity; and
our own sense of their misery is sharpened by the thought
that anything we can do ·for them· is unavailing, and that
the regret, the love, and the lamentations of their friends,
which alleviate every other kind of distress, can’t bring them
any comfort. But it is absolutely certain that the welfare of
the dead isn’t affected by any of this; the profound security
of their repose can’t be disturbed by the thought of any of
these things. The idea of the dreary and endless melancholy
that our imagination naturally ascribes to their condition is
purely a result of putting together

•the change that they have undergone,
•our own consciousness of that change,
•our putting ourselves in their situation—inserting
our living souls into their dead bodies (so to speak),
and conceiving what our emotions would be in that
situation.

It is just •this illusion of the imagination that makes the
thought of our own dissolution so terrible to us. It’s because
of •it that the thought of circumstances that undoubtedly
can’t give us pain when we are dead makes us miserable
while we are alive. That is the source of one of the most
important action-drivers in human nature, namely the dread
of death, which is the great poison to happiness but the
great restraint on the injustice of mankind; it afﬂicts and
humiliates the individual, while guarding and protecting
society.

Chapter 2: The pleasure of mutual sympathy

and nothing shocks us more than the seeming absence of
such fellow-feeling. Those who are fond of deriving all our
sentiments from certain reﬁnements of self-love think they
can explain this pleasure and this pain consistently with
their own principles. Their explanation goes like this:

Man is conscious of his own weakness, and of his
need for the assistance of others; so he rejoices when
he sees that they do adopt his own passions, because
this assures him of that assistance; and he grieves
when he sees that they don’t, because that assures
him of their opposition.

But both the pleasure and the pain are always felt so
instantaneously, and often on such minor issues, that it
seems evident that neither of them can come from any such
self-interested consideration. A man is cast down when,
after having tried to be amusing, he looks around and sees
that no-one else laughs at his jokes; and when his jokes
do succeed, he gets great pleasure from the amusement
of the people he is with, and regards this match between
their sentiments and his own as the greatest applause. ·It’s
not plausible to suggest that what’s going on here is rapid
calculation about whether he will be helped in times of need·.
[Smith’s next paragraph is not unclear but is very com-
pressed. What follows here is a more fully spelled-out
statement of its content. Our immediate topic is (let’s say) the
pleasure I get from seeing that my companions are enjoying
my jokes. Smith has been expounding this explanation of
the pleasure:

(1) I enjoy the jokes, and I want others to sympathize
with my frame of mind by enjoying them too; and I
suffer disappointment if this doesn’t happen.

Whatever the cause of sympathy may be, and however it
may be aroused, nothing pleases us more than to observe in
others a fellow-feeling with all the emotions of our own breast,

This, Smith holds, is an instance of the natural universal hu-
man desire for others to show sympathy. In our present
paragraph he mentions a different possible explanation:

4

Smith on Moral Sentiments

Pleasure of mutual sympathy

(2) I enjoy the jokes; if others also enjoy them, then by
sympathetically taking in their pleasure I increase my
own; and if they don’t enjoy them, I suffer from the
absence of a hoped-for extra pleasure.

This has nothing to do with a desire to be sympathised with;
it is simply an instance of sympathy. This may be a part of
the story, Smith says, but isn’t all of it. Now let him take
over:] When we have read a book or poem so often that we
can no longer enjoy reading it by ourselves, we can still take
pleasure in reading it to a companion. To him it has all the
graces of novelty; we enter into the surprise and admiration
that it naturally arouses in him but can no longer arouse
in us; we consider the ideas that it presents in the light in
which they appear to him rather than in the light in which
they appear to ourselves, and we enjoy by sympathy his
enjoyment that thus enlivens our own.
If he seemed not
to be entertained by the book, we would be annoyed and
could no longer take pleasure in reading it to him. It’s like
that with our attempts to amuse others. The company’s
merriment no doubt enlivens our own, and their silence no
doubt disappoints us. But though this may contribute both
to the pleasure we get from success and the pain we feel if we
fail, it is far from being the only cause of either the pleasure
or the pain; it can’t account for the pleasure we get when
our sentiments are matched by the sentiments of others, or
the pain that comes from a failure of such a match. [The main
thing Smith says about why that’s not the whole story is that it can’t be
any of the grief or pain side of the story.] I hope my friends will feel
sad when I am sad, but not because I want their feelings to
reﬂect back on me and increase my sadness! I do want their
sympathy; if they show that they sympathize, this alleviates
grief by insinuating into the heart almost the only agreeable
sensation that it is capable of receiving at that time. ·The
pattern here is that of (1) and not (2)·.

So it’s important to notice ·that the grief and pain side
is more important to us than the joy side·. We’re more
concerned to communicate to our friends our disagreeable
passions than our agreeable ones; and it’s in connection
with the disagreeable passions that we get more satisfaction
from their sympathy and are more upset when they don’t
sympathize.

When an unfortunate person ﬁnds others to whom he
can communicate the cause of his sorrow, how does this
bring him relief? Their sympathy seems to unload some
of his burden of distress; it’s not wrong to say that they
share it with him. . . . Yet by recounting his misfortunes he
to some extent renews his grief. They awaken in his memory
the remembrance of the circumstances that brought about
his afﬂiction. His tears accordingly ﬂow faster than before,
and he is apt to abandon himself to all the weakness of
sorrow. But he takes pleasure in all this, and can be seen to
be relieved by it, because the sweetness of their sympathy
more than compensates for the bitterness of his sorrow—the
sorrow that he had thus enlivened and renewed in order
to arouse this sympathy. The cruelest insult that can be
offered to the unfortunate is to appear to make light of their
calamities. To seem not to be affected with the joy of our
companions is mere •impoliteness; but not to have a serious
expression when they tell us their afﬂictions is real and gross
•inhumanity.

Love is an agreeable passion, resentment a disagreeable
one; and accordingly we’re not half so anxious that our
friends should adopt our friendships as that they should
enter into our resentments. We can forgive them for seeming
not to be much affected when some favour comes our way,
but we lose all patience if they seem not to care about
injuries that have been done to us; and we aren’t half as
angry with them for not entering into our gratitude as for

5

not sympathizing with our resentment. They can easily
avoid being friends to our friends, but can hardly avoid
being enemies to those with whom we are at odds. We may
sometimes make a gesture towards an awkward quarrel
with them if they are at enmity with any of our friends, but
we don’t usually outright resent this; whereas we seriously
quarrel with them if they live in friendship with any of our
enemies. The agreeable passions of love and joy can satisfy
and support the heart without any supplementary pleasure,
but the bitter and painful emotions of grief and resentment
strongly require the healing consolation of sympathy.

Just as the person who is primarily concerned in any
event is pleased with our sympathy and hurt by the lack
of it, so also we seem to be pleased when we can sym-
pathize with him and upset when we can’t. We run not
only to congratulate the successful but also to condole with
the afﬂicted; and the •pleasure we get from contact with
someone with whom we can entirely sympathize in all the
passions of his heart seems to do more than compensate
for the •painfulness of the sorrow that our knowledge of his
situation gives us. When we ﬁnd that we can’t sympathize
with a friend’s sorrow, that spares us sympathetic pain;
but there’s no pleasure in that. If we hear someone loudly
lamenting his misfortunes, and ﬁnd that when we bring
his case home to ourselves it has no such violent effect on
us, we are shocked at his grief; and because we can’t enter
into it we call it pusillanimity and weakness.
[English still
contains ‘pusillanimous’, from Latin meaning ‘small mind’; here it means
something like ‘weak-spirited, lacking in gumption’.] And on the other
side, if we see someone being too happy or too much elevated
(we think) over some little piece of good fortune, this irritates
us. . . . We are even annoyed if our companion laughs louder
or longer at a joke than we think it deserves—i.e. longer than
we feel that we could laugh at it.

Chapter 3: How we judge the propriety of other men’s
affections by their concord or dissonance with our own

[•Smith uses ‘affection’ about 200 times, usually in a meaning that
sprawls across feelings and mental attitudes of all kinds; on page 117
and a few other places it express the idea of someone’s being ‘affection-
ate’ in our sense. There is no satisfactory way to sort this out; you’ll
have to be guided by the context of each use. As for the cognate verb:
when Smith writes of our being ‘differently affected’ by something he
means that it causes us to have different ‘affections’ in the very broad
•In Smith’s day ‘propriety’ meant ‘correctness’, ‘rightness’;
it
sense.
was a very general term to cover one side of the right/wrong line.
It
won’t be replaced by anything else in this version; but remember that it
does not mean here what it tends to mean today, namely ‘conformity to
conventional standards of behaviour’. •Smith often uses ‘concord’ as a
musical metaphor, to express the idea of a satisfactory match between
your sentiments and mine, in contrast to a discord or ‘dissonance’. We’ll
see in due course that he uses musical metaphors a lot. e.g. on page 10
where we ﬁnd ‘ﬂatten’ ((cid:91)). ‘sharpness’ ((cid:93)), ‘tone’, ‘harmony’, and ‘concord’
in one short sentence.]

When someone’s passions are in perfect concord with
the sympathetic emotions of the spectator, they necessarily
strike the spectator as being just and proper, and suitable to
their •objects; and if on the other hand the spectator ﬁnds
that when he brings the case home to himself those passions
don’t coincide with what he feels, they necessarily appear to
him unjust and improper, and unsuitable to the •causes that
arouse them. Expressing approval of someone’s passions
as suitable to their •objects is the same thing as saying
that we entirely sympathize with them; and disapproving
them as not suitable to their •objects is the same thing as
saying that we don’t entirely sympathize with them. [Smith
does not distinguish a passion’s ‘object’ from its ‘cause’.] The man
who resents the injuries that have been done to me, and

6

Smith on Moral Sentiments

Judging others’ affections

sees that I resent them precisely as he does, necessarily
approves of my resentment. . . . He who admires a picture
or poem in the way I do must surely admit the justness
of my admiration. He who laughs along with me at a joke
can’t very well deny the propriety of my laughter. And on
the other hand, someone who in such cases either feels no
emotion such as I feel, or feels none that have a level of
intensity anywhere near to mine, can’t avoid disapproving
my sentiments because of their dissonance with his own. . . .
If my grief exceeds what his most tender compassion can go
along with, if my admiration is either too high or too low to
ﬁt with his, if I laugh heartily when he only smiles, or I only
smile when he laughs heartily—in all these cases, as soon
as he moves from considering the object to seeing how I am
affected by it, I must incur some degree of his disapproval
depending on how much disproportion there is between his
sentiments and mine. On all occasions his own sentiments
are the standards and measures by which he judges mine.
Approving of another man’s opinions—adopting those
opinions—they are the same thing! If the arguments that
convince you convince me too, I necessarily approve of your
conviction; and if they don’t, I necessarily disapprove of
it. . . . Everyone accepts that approving or disapproving
of the opinions of others is observing the agreement or
disagreement of those opinions with our own. Well, this is
equally the case with regard to our approval or disapproval
of the sentiments or passions of others.

[Smith mentions a class of counter-examples. •I see that
the joke is funny and that I would ordinarily laugh at it,
but right now I’m not in the mood for jokes. •Someone is
pointed out to me on the street as grieving for the recent
death of his father; I can’t share in his grief, because I don’t
know him or his father; but I don’t doubt that if I were fully
informed of all the details of his situation I would fully and

sincerely sympathize with him. Smith continues:] The basis
for my approval of his sorrow is my consciousness of this
conditional sympathy, although the actual sympathy doesn’t
take place. . . .

The sentiment or affection of the heart that leads to some
action can be considered in two different relations: (1) in
relation to the cause that arouses it, or the motive that
gives rise to it; (2) in relation to the end that it proposes, or
the effect that it tends to produce. [Smith builds into this
one-sentence paragraph a striking clause saying that the
‘whole virtue or vice’ of the action ‘must ultimately depend’
on the sentiment or affection of the heart that leads to it.
And in the next paragraph he says it again:]

The propriety or impropriety. . . .of the consequent action
consists in the suitableness or unsuitableness, the propor-
tion or disproportion, that the affection seems to bear to the
cause or object that arouses it.

The merit or demerit of the action, the qualities by which
it is entitled to reward or deserving of punishment, consists
in the beneﬁcial or harmful nature of the effects that the
affection aims at or tends to produce.

In recent years philosophers have focussed on the
•behavioural upshots of affections, to the neglect of an affec-
tion’s relation to the •cause that arouses it. But in everyday
life when we judge someone’s conduct and the sentiments
that directed it we constantly consider them under both
these aspects. When we blame someone’s excesses of love,
of grief, of resentment, we consider not only the ruinous
effects that they tend to produce but also the slightness of
their causes. ‘The merit of his favourite’, we say, ‘is not so
great, his misfortune is not so dreadful, his provocation is
not so extraordinary, as to justify such violent passion. We
would have approved or at least indulged the violence of his
emotion if its cause had been anything like proportional to

7

Smith on Moral Sentiments

The same continued

it.’

When in this way we judge any affection to be or not be
proportional to the cause that arouses it, we are judging by
the corresponding affection in ourselves when we bring the
case home to our own breast—what other criterion could we
possibly use?. . . .

A man uses each of his faculties as the standard by which
he judges the same faculty in someone else. I judge your
sight by my sight, your ear by my ear, your reason by my
reason, your resentment by my resentment, your love by my
love. I don’t have—I can’t have—any other way of judging
them.

Chapter 4: The same subject continued

There are two different classes of cases in which we judge
the propriety or impropriety of someone else’s sentiments
by their correspondence or disagreement with our own. (1)
In one class, the objects that arouse the sentiments are
considered without any special relation to ourselves or to the
person whose sentiments we are judging. (2) In the other,
those objects ·or causes· are considered as specially affecting
one or other of us.

(1) With regard to objects that are considered without any
special relation either to ourselves or to the person whose
sentiments we are judging: wherever his sentiments entirely
correspond with our own, we credit him with having taste
and good judgment.

The beauty of a plain,
the greatness of a mountain,
the ornaments of a building,
the expression of a picture,
the composition of a speech,
the conduct of a third person,

the proportions of different quantities and numbers,
the various appearances that the great machine of the
universe is perpetually exhibiting, with their secret
causes

—all the general subjects of science and taste are what we
and the other person regard as having no special relation
to either of us. We both look at them from the same point
of view, and we can produce the most perfect harmony of
sentiments and affections without any help from sympathy
or the imaginary switch of situations from which sympathy
arises. If despite this our affections are often different, this
is either because •our different habits of life lead us to give
different degrees of attention to the various parts of those
complex objects, or •we differ in the natural acuteness of the
mental faculties to which the objects are addressed.

When our companion’s sentiments coincide with our
own over things like this—things that are obvious and
easy, things that everyone would respond to in the same
way—we do of course approve of his sentiments, but they
don’t entitle him to praise or admiration. But when they
don’t just coincide with our own but lead and direct our
own; when in forming them he appears to have attended
to many things that we had overlooked, and to have made
them responsive to all the various details of their objects;
we not only approve of his sentiments but wonder and are
surprised at their uncommon and unexpected acuteness
and comprehensiveness. In this case he appears to deserve
a high degree of •admiration and •applause. For approval
heightened by wonder and surprise constitutes the sentiment
that is properly called •‘admiration’, the natural expression
of it being •applause.
[In this next sentence and in many further
places, ‘ugliness’ replaces Smith’s ‘deformity’, and similarly with ‘ugly’
and ‘deformed’. That clearly is what he means by ‘deformed’ and ‘de-
formity’; like some other writers of his time he seems to have preferred

8

Smith on Moral Sentiments

The same continued

those two words over ‘ugly’ and ‘ugliness’, which occur only once each
in this entire work.] The verdict of the man who judges that
exquisite beauty is preferable to gross ugliness, or that twice
two are equal to four, must certainly be approved of by us
all but surely we won’t much admire it. What arouses our
admiration, and seems to deserve our applause is

•the acute and delicate discernment of the man of
taste, who distinguishes the tiny barely perceptible
differences of beauty and ugliness; and
•the comprehensive accuracy of the experienced math-
ematician, who easily unravels the most intricate and
puzzling proportions.

In short, the greater part of the praise we give to what are
called ‘the intellectual virtues’ goes to the great leader in
science and taste, the man who directs and leads our own
sentiments, and ﬁlls us with astonished wonder and surprise
by the extent and superior soundness of his talents.

You may think that what ﬁrst recommend those talents
to us is their utility; and no doubt the thought of their
utility does give them a new value, once we get around to
it. But at the start we approve of another man’s judgment
not as •useful but as •right, precise, agreeable to truth and
reality; and it’s obvious that we attribute those qualities to
his judgment simply because it agrees with our own.
In
the same way, taste is initially approved of not as •useful
but as •just, delicate, and precisely suited to its object. The
thought that such qualities as these are useful is clearly
an after-thought, not what ﬁrst recommends them to our
approval.

[We are about to meet the word ‘injury’. Its meaning in Smith’s day
was in one way •broader and in another •narrower than its meaning
today. •It wasn’t even slightly restricted to physical injury; it covered
every kind of harm, though only when •the harm was caused by a
person.]

(2) With regard to objects that affect in some special
way either ourselves or the person whose sentiments we
are judging, it’s •harder to preserve this matching of senti-
ments and also •vastly more important to do so. ·Harder·:
When I suffer some misfortune or am done some injury,
my companion doesn’t naturally take the same view of this
as I do.
It affects me much more nearly. He and I don’t
see it from the same vantage-point, as we do a picture, a
poem, or a scientiﬁc theory, so we are apt to be differently
affected by it. ·More important·: A lack of correspondence
of our sentiments with regard to objects that don’t concern
either me or my companion is easier for me to take than
such a lack with regard to something that concerns me
as much as the misfortune that I have encountered or the
injury that has been done to me. There’s not much danger
that you and I will quarrel over a picture, a poem, or even
a scientiﬁc theory that I admire and you despise. Neither
of us can reasonably care very much about them. They
ought all of them to be matters of little signiﬁcance to us
both, so that although our opinions may be opposite we
may still have friendly feelings towards one another. But it’s
quite otherwise with regard to objects by which one of us
is especially affected. Though your judgments in matters
of theory or your sentiments in matters of taste are quite
opposite to mine, I can easily overlook this opposition; and if
I’m not temperamentally angry and quarrelsome I may still
enjoy conversation with you, even on those very subjects.
But if you have no fellow-feeling for the misfortunes I have
met with, or none that bears any proportion to the grief that
is consuming me, or if you have no indignation at the injuries
I have suffered, or none that bears any proportion to the
resentment that is taking me over, the two of us can’t talk
together about this subject. We become intolerable to one
another. . . . You are bewildered by my violence and passion,

9

Smith on Moral Sentiments

The same continued

and I am enraged by your cold lack of feeling.

In any such case, what is needed for there to be some
correspondence of sentiments between the spectator and
his companion is for the spectator to try his hardest to put
himself in the other man’s situation and to bring home to
himself every little detail of distress that could possibly have
occurred to the sufferer. He must adopt the situation of
his companion with all its tiniest details, and try to make
as perfect as possible the imaginary change of situation on
which his sympathy is based.

Even after all this, the spectator’s emotions won’t be
as violent as the sufferer’s. Although people are naturally
sympathetic, they never respond to what has happened to an-
other person with the level of passion that naturally animates
that person himself.
[A couple of dozen times Smith refers to the
latter as ‘the person principally concerned’. This will usually be replaced
by the shorter ‘the sufferer’, a label that Smith also uses quite often.]
The imaginary change of situation on which their sympathy
is based is only momentary. The thought of their own safety,
the thought that they aren’t really the sufferers, continually
pushes into their minds; and though this doesn’t prevent
them from having a passion somewhat analogous to what the
sufferer feels, it does prevent them from coming anywhere
near to matching the level of intensity of his passion. The
sufferer is aware of this, while passionately wanting a more
complete sympathy. He longs for the relief that he can only
get from the perfect concord of the spectators’ affections with
his own. . . . But his only chance of getting this is to lower his
passion to a level at which the spectators are capable of going
along with him. He must ﬂatten (if I may put it this way) the
sharpness of his passion’s natural tone so as to bring it into
harmony and concord with the emotions of the people he is
with. What they feel will always be in some respects different
from what he feels. Compassion can never be exactly the

same as original sorrow, because the sympathizer’s secret
awareness that he is only imagining being in the sufferer’s
position doesn’t just lower the degree ·of intensity· of his
sympathetic sentiment but also makes it somewhat different
in kind. Still, it’s clear that these two sentiments correspond
with one another well enough for the harmony of society.
They won’t ever be unisons, but they can be concords, and
this is all that is wanted or required.

In order to produce this concord, nature teaches the
spectators to take on the situation of the sufferer, and
teaches the sufferer to go some way in taking on the situation
of the spectators. Just as they are continually placing them-
selves in his situation and thereby experiencing emotions
similar to his, so he is as constantly placing himself in
their situation and thereby experiencing some degree of
the coolness that he’s aware they will have regarding his
fortune. They constantly think about what they would feel
if they actually were the sufferers, and he is constantly led
to imagine how he would be affected if he were one of the
spectators. . . . The effect of this is to lower the violence of his
passion, especially when he is in their presence and under
their observation.

A result of this is that the mind is rarely so disturbed that
the company of a friend won’t restore it to some degree of
tranquillity. The breast is somewhat calmed and composed
the moment we come into our friend’s presence. . . . We
expect less sympathy from an ordinary acquaintance than
from a friend; we can’t share with the acquaintance all
the little details that we can unfold to a friend; so when
we are with the acquaintance we calm down and try to
ﬁx our thoughts on the general outlines of our situation
that he is willing to consider. We expect still less sympathy
from a gathering of strangers, so in their presence we calm
down even further, trying—as we always do—to bring down

10

Smith on Moral Sentiments

Likeable and respectworthy virtues

our passion to a pitch that the people we are with may be
expected to go along with. We don’t just seem to calm down.
If we are at all masters of ourselves, the presence of a mere
acquaintance really will compose us more than that of a
friend; and the presence of a gathering of strangers will
compose us even more.

So, at any time when the mind has lost its tranquillity,
the best cures are •society and •conversation. They are also
the best preservatives of the balanced and happy frame of
mind that is so necessary for self-satisfaction and enjoyment.
Scholarly recluses who are apt to sit at home brooding
over either grief or resentment, though they may have more
humaneness, more generosity, and a more delicate sense of
honour, seldom possess the evenness of temperament that
is so common among men of the world.

Chapter 5: The likeable virtues and the respectworthy
virtues

We have here two different efforts—(1) the spectator’s effort
to enter into the sentiments of the sufferer, and (2) the
sufferer’s efforts to bring his emotions down to a level where
the spectator can go along with them. These are the bases
for two different sets of virtues.
(1) One is the basis for
the soft, gentle, likeable virtues, the virtues of openness
to others and indulgent humaneness.
(2) The other is
the source of the great, awe-inspiring and respectworthy
virtues, the virtues of self-denial and self-control—i.e. the
command of our passions that subjects all the movements
of our nature to the requirements of our own dignity and
honour, and the propriety of our own conduct. [Smith’s words
are ‘amiable’ and ‘respectable’, but their present meanings—especially
of ‘respectable’—would make them too distracting. Regarding ‘propriety’:
remind yourself of the note on page 116.]

(1) Someone whose sympathetic heart seems to echo all
the sentiments of those he is in contact with, who grieves for
their calamities, resents their injuries, and rejoices at their
good fortune—how likeable he seems to be! When we bring
home to ourselves the situation of his companions, we enter
into their gratitude and feel what consolation they must get
from the tender sympathy of such an affectionate friend. As
for someone whose hard and stubborn heart feels for no-one
but himself, and who has no sense of the happiness or misery
of others—how disagreeable he seems to be! Here again we
enter into the pain that his presence must give to everyone
who has anything to do with him, and especially to those
with whom we are most apt to sympathize, the unfortunate
and the injured.

(2) Now consider someone who, in his own case, exerts
the togetherness and self-control that constitute the dignity
of every passion, bringing it down to what others can enter
into—what noble propriety and grace do we feel in his con-
duct! We’re disgusted with the clamorous grief that bluntly
calls on our compassion with sighs and tears and begging
lamentations. But we reverence the reserved, silent, majestic
sorrow that reveals itself only in the swelling of the eyes, in
the quivering of the lips and cheeks, and in the distant yet
touching coolness of the whole behaviour. It imposes the
same silence on us. We regard it with respectful attention,
and keep a cautious watch on our own behaviour lest we
should do anything to disturb the over-all tranquillity that it
takes such an effort to maintain.

On the other side, there is nothing more detestable than
the insolence and brutality of the anger of someone who
indulges its fury without check or restraint.
[We are about
to meet the word ‘generous’, used—as it often is by Smith—in a sense
that it doesn’t often have today: ‘noble-minded, magnanimous, free from
meanness or prejudice’.] But we admire the noble and generous

11

Smith on Moral Sentiments

Likeable and respectworthy virtues

resentment that •governs its pursuit of ·the author of· great
injuries not by the rage that such injuries are apt to arouse
in the breast of the sufferer, but by the indignation that they
naturally call forth in the breast of an impartial spectator;
that •allows no word or gesture to escape it that wouldn’t be
dictated by this more equitable sentiment [i.e. by the feelings of
an impartial spectator]; that •never, even in thought, attempts
any greater vengeance or wants to inﬂict any greater pun-
ishment than what every person who isn’t directly involved
would be happy to see inﬂicted.

·Putting those two sets of virtues together· we get the
result that to feel much for others and little for ourselves,
to restrain our selﬁsh affections and indulge our benevolent
affections, constitutes the perfection of human nature. It
is only through this that men can have the harmony of
sentiments and passions that constitutes their whole grace
and propriety. The great law of Christianity is

Love your neighbour as you love yourself;

and the great precept of nature is

Love yourself only as you love your neighbour

—or, what comes to the same thing, as your neighbour is
capable of loving you.

Just as taste and good judgment, when considered as
qualities that deserve praise and admiration, are supposed to
imply an uncommon delicacy of sentiment and acuteness of
understanding, so the virtues of sensitivity and self-control
are thought of as consisting in uncommon degrees of those
qualities. The likeable virtue of humaneness requires, surely,
a level of sensitivity far higher than is possessed by crude
ordinary people. The great and exalted virtue of magnanimity
undoubtedly demands a much higher degree of self-control
than the weakest of mortals could exert. Just as the com-
mon level of intellect doesn’t involve any notable talents,
so the common level of moral qualities doesn’t involve any

virtues. Virtue is excellence—something uncommonly great
and beautiful, rising far above what is vulgar and ordinary.
The likeable virtues consist in a degree of sensitivity that
surprises us by its exquisite and unexpected delicacy and
tenderness. The awe-inspiring and respectworthy virtues
consist in a degree of self-control that astonishes us by its
amazing superiority over the most ungovernable passions of
human nature.

We here encounter the considerable difference between
•virtue and mere •propriety; between the qualities and ac-
tions that deserve to be •admired and celebrated, and the
qualities that merely deserve to be •approved of. To act with
the most perfect propriety often requires no more than the
common and ordinary degree of sensitivity or self-control that
even the most worthless of mankind have, and sometimes
not even that is needed. To give a humdrum example: in
ordinary circumstances if you are hungry it is perfectly right
and proper for you to eat, and everyone would agree about
that; but no-one would call your eating virtuous!

·Thus, there can be perfect propriety without virtue. And
there can also be virtue without perfect propriety·. Actions
that fall short of perfect propriety often have a good deal
of virtue in them, because they are nearer to perfection
than could well be expected in a context where perfection
of conduct would be extremely difﬁcult to attain; this is
often the case in situations calling for the greatest efforts
of self-control. Some situations put so much pressure on
human nature that none of us, imperfect creatures that we
are, is capable of the degree of self-control that is ·called for.
I mean: the degree that is needed· to silence the voice of
human weakness, or reduce the violence of the passions to a
level where the impartial spectator can entirely share them.
In such a case, though the sufferer’s behaviour falls short
of the most perfect propriety, it may deserve some applause

12

Smith on Moral Sentiments

The passions that originate in the body

and even qualify as (in a certain sense) ‘virtuous’, because it
shows an effort of high-mindedness and magnanimity that
most men are not capable of. . . .

In cases of this kind, when we are settling how much
blame or applause an action deserves, we often use two
different standards. (1) One standard is the idea of complete
propriety and perfection, which in these difﬁcult situations
no human conduct could ever achieve. . . . (2) The other stan-
dard is the idea of the nearness to this complete perfection

that the actions of most men commonly achieve. Whatever
goes beyond this seems to deserve applause, and whatever
falls short of it to deserve blame.

[Smith adds a paragraph about a similar double standard
in judging works of art that ‘address themselves to the imag-
ination’: •the idea of complete but not humanly attainable
perfection that the critic has in his mind, and •the idea of
how near to complete perfection most works of art get.]

Section 2: The degrees of the different passions that are consistent with propriety

Introduction
For a passion aroused by an object that is specially related
to oneself, the proper level of intensity—the level at which
the spectator can go along with it—is clearly somewhere
in the middle [Smith: ‘. . . must lie in a certain mediocrity’]. If the
passion is too high, or too low, the spectator can’t enter into
it. Grief and resentment for private misfortunes and injuries
can easily be too high, and in most people they are. They
aren’t often too low, but this can happen. We call too-high
passion ‘weakness’ and ‘fury’, and we call too-low passion
‘stupidity’, ‘insensibility’, and ‘lack of spirit’. We can’t enter
into either of them, and are astonished and confused to see
them.

This middling level that is needed for propriety is different
It is high for some, low for others.
for different passions.
(1) There are some passions that it is indecent to •express
very strongly, even when it is acknowledged that we can’t
avoid •feeling them in the highest degree.
(2) And there

are others of which the strongest •expressions are often ·so
proper as to count as· extremely graceful, even though the
passions themselves aren’t necessarily •felt so strongly. The
(1) passions are the ones with which, for certain reasons,
there is little or no sympathy; the (2) passions are those with
which, for other reasons, there is the greatest sympathy.
And if we consider the whole range of passions that human
nature is capable of, we’ll ﬁnd that they are regarded as
decent (or indecent) exactly in proportion as mankind are
more (or less) disposed to sympathize with them.

Chapter 1: The passions that originate in the body

(1) It is indecent to express any strong degree of •the passions
that arise from a certain situation or disposition of one’s
body, because the people one is with aren’t in that bodily
state and so can’t be expected to sympathize with •them.
Violent hunger, for example, though on many occasions it’s

13

Smith on Moral Sentiments

The passions that originate in the body

not only natural but unavoidable, is always indecent, and
to eat voraciously is universally regarded as a piece of ill
manners. Still, there is some level of sympathy even with
hunger. It is agreeable to see our companions eat with a
•good appetite; any expression of •loathing for the food one
has tasted is offensive. A healthy man’s normal bodily state
makes his stomach easily keep time (forgive the coarseness!)
with •one and not with •the other. We can sympathize
with the distress of excessive hunger when we read the
description of a siege or sea-voyage.
Imagining ourselves
in the situation of the sufferers, we can easily conceive the
•grief, fear and consternation that must necessarily distract
them. We ourselves feel some degree of •those passions, and
therefore sympathize with them; but reading the description
doesn’t make us hungry, so it’s not strictly accurate to say
that we sympathize with their hunger.

It’s the same with the passion by which Nature unites
the sexes. Though it is naturally the most furious of all
the passions, strong expressions of it are always indecent,
even between persons who are totally allowed, by human
and divine laws, to indulge this passion together. Still, there
seems to be some degree of sympathy even with this passion.
It is not proper to talk to a woman as we would to a man;
it is expected that their company should inspire us with
more gaiety, more pleasantry, and more attention; and an
entire insensibility to the fair sex makes a man somewhat
contemptible even to men. [This paragraph seems to run together
•sympathy with my female companion’s sexual feelings with •sensitivity
to the fact that my companion is female. This oddity is present in the
original; it’s not an artifact of this version.]

We have such an aversion for all the appetites that origi-
nate in the body that we ﬁnd all strong expressions of them
loathsome and disagreeable. Some ancient philosophers
held that these are the passions that we share with the

lower animals, so that they are beneath our dignity because
they have no connection with the characteristic qualities of
human nature. But there are many other passions that we
have in common with the lower animals—e.g. resentment,
natural affection, even gratitude—that don’t strike us as
animal-like. The real cause of the special disgust we have
for the body’s appetites when we see them in other men is
that we can’t enter into them, ·can’t sympathize with them·.
To the person who has such a passion, as soon as it is
gratiﬁed the object that aroused it ceases to be agreeable;
even its presence often becomes offensive to him; he looks in
vain for the charm that swept him away the moment before,
and he can’t now enter into his own passion any more than
anyone else can. After we have dined, we order the table
to be cleared; and we would treat in the same manner the
objects of the most ardent and passionate desires if they
were the objects only of passions that originate in the body.
The virtue of temperance, properly so-called, is the com-
mand of the body’s appetites. •Prudence involves keeping
those appetites within the limits required by •a concern
for one’s health and fortune. But •temperance keeps them
within the limits required by •grace, propriety, delicacy, and
modesty.

(2) It’s for that same reason that it always seems unmanly
and unbecoming to cry out with bodily pain, however in-
tolerable it is. Yet there is a good deal of sympathy even
with bodily pain. I remarked earlier that if I see a truncheon
about to come down on someone else’s arm, I naturally
shrink and draw back my own arm; and when the blow falls
I feel it in some measure, and I am hurt by it as well as the
sufferer. But my hurt is very slight, so that if he makes a
violent outcry I will despise him because I can’t go along with
him. That’s how it is with all the passions that originate in
the body; they arouse ·in the spectator· either no sympathy

14

Smith on Moral Sentiments

The passions that originate in the body

at all or such a low level of sympathy that it is altogether
disproportionate to the violence of what the sufferer feels.

It is quite otherwise with passions that originate in the
imagination. The state of my •body can’t be much affected
by changes that are brought about in my companion’s body;
but my •imagination is more pliable, and (so to speak) more
readily takes on the shape and lay-out of the imaginations of
people I have contact with. That’s why a disappointment in
love or ambition will evoke more sympathy than the greatest
bodily evil. Those passions arise purely from the imagination.
The person who has lost his whole fortune, if he is in good
health, feels nothing in his body. What he suffers comes
entirely from his imagination, which represents to him the
rapid approach of the loss of his dignity, neglect by his
friends, contempt from his enemies, dependency, poverty
and misery; and we sympathize with him more strongly on
account of this misfortune ·than we do for any physical pain
he is suffering· because it’s easier for our imaginations to
mould themselves on his imagination than for our bodies to
mould themselves on his body.

The loss of a leg may generally be regarded as a more
real calamity than the loss of a mistress. Yet it would
be a ridiculous ·dramatic· tragedy of which the ·central·
catastrophe was to concern the loss of a leg; whereas a
misfortune of the other kind, however trivial it may appear
to be, has given occasion to many a ﬁne tragic drama.

Nothing is as quickly forgotten as pain. The moment it is
gone the whole agony of it is over, and the thought of it can
no longer give us any sort of disturbance. After the pain is
over, we ourselves can’t enter into the anxiety and anguish
that we had during it. An unguarded word from a friend
will cause a more durable unhappiness—the agony it creates
is by no means over once the word has gone. What at ﬁrst
disturbs us is not the object of the senses (·the sound of

the word·) but the idea of the imagination (·the meaning of
the word·); and just because it is an idea, the thought of it
continues to fret and rufﬂe the imagination until time and
other episodes in some measure erase it from our memory, .
Pain never evokes any lively sympathy unless danger
comes with it. We sympathize with sufferer’s fear but not
with his agony. Fear is a passion derived entirely from
the imagination, which represents not what we really now
feel but what we may suffer later on. (It represents this in
an uncertain and ﬂuctuating way, but that only makes it
worse.) The gout or the tooth-ache, though intensely painful,
arouse little sympathy; more dangerous diseases, even when
accompanied by little pain, arouse sympathy in the highest
degree.

Some people faint and grow sick at the sight of a surgical
operation; the bodily pain caused by tearing the ﬂesh seems
to arouse the most excessive sympathy in them. We do
conceive in a much more lively and distinct manner the
pain that comes from an external cause than pain coming
from an internal disorder.
I can hardly form an idea of
my neighbour’s agonies when he is tortured by gout or a
gallstone; but I have the clearest conception of what he must
suffer from an incision, a wound, or a fracture. But the main
reason why such objects produce such violent effects on us
·as spectators· is that we aren’t used to them. Someone
who has seen a dozen dissections and as many amputations
will from then on see all operations of this kind with great
calmness and often with no feeling at all for the sufferer. . . .
Some of the Greek tragedies try to arouse compassion by
representing the agonies of bodily pain. Philoctetes cries out
and faints from the extremity of his sufferings. Hippolytus
and Hercules are both introduced as dying from the severest
tortures—ones that seem to have been more than even the
fortitude of Hercules could bear. But in all these cases,

15

Smith on Moral Sentiments

Passions that originate in the imagination

what concerns us is not the pain but other features of the
situation. What affects us is not Philoctetes’s sore foot but
his solitude, which diffuses over that charming tragedy the
romantic wildness that is so agreeable to the imagination.
The agonies of Hercules and Hippolytus are interesting only
because we foresee that death will result from them.
If
those heroes recovered, we would think the representation of
their sufferings to have been perfectly ridiculous. . . . These
attempts to arouse compassion by the representation of
bodily pain may be regarded as among the Greek theatre’s
greatest failures of good manners.

The propriety of constancy and patience in enduring
bodily pain is based on the fact that we feel little sympathy
with such pain. The man who under the severest tortures
allows no weakness to escape him, who doesn’t utter a
groan or give way to any passion that we ·spectators· don’t
entirely enter into, commands our highest admiration. His
ﬁrmness enables him to keep time with our indifference
and insensibility. We admire and entirely go along with
the magnanimous effort that he makes for this purpose. We
•approve of his behaviour, and our experience of the common
weakness of human nature makes us •surprised by it, and
we wonder what enabled him to act so as to deserve approval.
Approval, mixed with an enlivening input of wonder and
surprise, constitutes the sentiment that is properly called
‘admiration’, of which applause—I repeat—is the natural
expression.

Chapter 2: The passions that originate in a particular
turn or habit of the imagination

Even some of the passions derived from the imagination
get little sympathy, although they may be acknowledged
to be perfectly natural.
I’m talking about passions that

16

originate in a special turn or habit that the imagination
has acquired. The imaginations of people in general, not
having acquired that particular turn, can’t enter into these
passions. The passions in question, though they may be
allowed to be almost unavoidable in some part of life, are
always somewhat ridiculous. An example is the strong
attachment that naturally grows up between two persons of
different sexes who have long ﬁxed their thoughts on one
another. Because our imagination hasn’t run in the same
channel as the lover’s, we can’t enter into the eagerness of
his emotions. •If our friend has been injured, we readily
sympathize with his resentment and grow angry with the
person with whom he is angry. •If he has received a beneﬁt,
we readily enter into his gratitude and have a high sense of
the merit of his benefactor. But •if he is in love, even though
we may think his passion is just as reasonable as any of that
kind, we don’t think ourselves bound to develop a passion
of the same kind and for the same person that he is in love
with. To everyone but the lover himself his passion seems
entirely disproportionate to the value of its object; and love,
though it is •pardoned. . . .because we know it is natural, is
always •laughed at because we can’t enter into it. All serious
and strong expressions of it appear ridiculous to a third
person; and a lover isn’t good company to anyone else except
his mistress. He himself is aware of this, and during his
periods of being in his sober senses he tries to treat his own
passion with mockery and ridicule. That is the only style in
which we care to •hear of it, because it’s the only style in
which we ourselves are disposed to •talk of it. We grow weary
of the solemn, pedantic, long-winded lovers of Cowley and
of Petrarch, who go on and on exaggerating the violence of
their attachments; but the gaiety of Ovid and the gallantry
of Horace are always agreeable.

Smith on Moral Sentiments

Passions that originate in the imagination

But though we feel no proper sympathy with an attach-
ment of this kind, though we never get close to imagining
ourselves as in love with that particular person, ·we aren’t
entirely cut off from the lover’s situation·. We have ourselves
fallen in love in that way, or are disposed to do so; and that
lets us readily enter into the high hopes of happiness that
the lover expects from his love’s gratiﬁcation, as well as into
the intense distress that he fears from its disappointment. It
concerns us not as a passion but as a situation that gives
rise to other passions that concern us—to hope, fear, and
distress of every kind.
(Similarly, when we read about a
sea voyage, our concern is not with the hunger but with the
distress that the hunger causes.) Without properly entering
into the lover’s attachment, we readily go along with the
expectations of romantic happiness that he gets from it. We
feel how natural it is for the mind, at a time when it is lazily
relaxed and fatigued with the violence of desire,

to long for serenity and quiet, to hope to ﬁnd them
in the gratiﬁcation of the passion that distracts it,
and to form for itself the idea of a life of pastoral
tranquillity and retirement of the sort that the elegant,
tender, and passionate ·Latin poet· Tibullus takes so
much pleasure in describing—a life like the one the
·ancient· poets describe in the Fortunate Islands, a
life of friendship, liberty, and repose; free from labour,
from care, and from all the turbulent passions that
accompany them.

Even scenes of this kind engage us most when they are
depicted as •hoped for rather than •actually enjoyed. The
grossness of the passion that is mixed in with love and is
perhaps its foundation disappears when its gratiﬁcation is
far off and at a distance; but when it is described as what
is immediately possessed it makes the whole description
offensive. For this reason [he means: because of the grossness of

lust] we are less drawn into the lover’s happy passion than
we are to the fearful and the melancholy ·aspects of it·.
We tremble for whatever can disappoint such natural and
agreeable hopes, and thus enter into all the anxiety, concern,
and distress of the lover.

[Smith now has a paragraph applying this line of thought
to the presentation of romantic love ‘in some modern
tragedies and romances’. Then:]

The reserve that the laws of society impose on the female
sex with regard to this weakness [i.e. with regard to romantic
love] makes it especially stressful for them; and for just that
reason we are more deeply concerned with their part in a
love situation. We are charmed with the •love of Phaedra as it
is expressed in Racine’s Phèdre, despite all the extravagance
and guilt that come with it. That very extravagance and guilt
are part of what recommends •it to us. Her fear, shame,
remorse, horror, despair, become thereby more natural and
engaging. All the secondary passions (if I may be allowed to
call them that) that arise from the situation of love become
necessarily more furious and violent, and it’s only with
these secondary passions that we can properly be said to
sympathize.

However, of all the passions that are so extravagantly
disproportionate to the value of their objects, love is the only
one that appears to have anything in it that is either graceful
or agreeable. (None of the others do, even to the weakest
minds!) ·It has three things going for it·:

•Although it may be ridiculous, it isn’t naturally odi-
ous.
•Although its consequences are often fatal and dreadful
its intentions are seldom bad.
•Although there is little propriety in the passion itself,
there’s a good deal of propriety in some of the passions
that always accompany it.

17

Smith on Moral Sentiments

The unsocial passions

There is in love a strong mixture of humaneness, gen-
erosity, kindness, friendship, esteem. And these are the
passions that we are most disposed to sympathize with, even
when we’re aware that they are somewhat excessive. The
sympathy that we feel with them makes the passion that
they accompany less disagreeable and supports it in our
imagination, despite all the vices that commonly go along
with it: always eventual ruin and infamy for the woman;
and for the man—though he is supposed to come off more
lightly—it usually causes inability to work, neglect of duty,
disregard of ·lost· reputation. [In the original, as in this version,
Smith doesn’t signal where he is switching from romantic love generally
to what he is evidently thinking of here—consummated romantic love
between two people who are not married to one another.] Despite all
this, the degree of sensibility and generosity that is supposed
to accompany such love makes it something that some people
are vain about—they like to appear to be capable of a feeling
that would do them no honour if they really did have it.

It’s for this kind of reason that a certain reserve is
necessary when we talk of our own friends, our own studies,
our own professions. We can’t expect our companions to be
as interested in these topics as we are. And it’s because of
a lack of this reserve that one half of mankind make bad
company for the other half. A philosopher is good company
only to another philosopher; the member of a club is good
company only to his own little knot of companions.

Chapter 3: The unsocial passions

There is another set of passions which, though derived from
the imagination, have to be scaled down if we are to be able
to enter into them or regard them as graceful or becoming; I
mean scaled down to a much lower level than undisciplined
nature gives them. These are •hatred and •resentment, with

all their varieties. With all such passions our sympathy is
divided between the person who feels them and the person
who is the object of them. The interests of these two are
directly opposite. What our sympathy with the person who
feels the passion would prompt us to •wish for is something
that our fellow-feeling with the other person would lead us
to •fear. Because they are both human we are concerned
for both, and our fear for what one may suffer damps our
resentment for what the other has suffered. So our sympathy
with the man who has received the provocation has to fall
short of the passion that naturally animates him, not only
for the general reason that all sympathetic passions are
inferior to the original ones, but also for the special reason
that in this case we also have an opposite sympathy towards
someone else. That is why resentment, more than almost any
other passion, can’t become graceful and agreeable unless
it is humbled and brought down below the pitch to which it
would naturally rise.

Any human being has a strong sense of the injuries that
are done to anyone else; the villain in a tragedy or romance is
as much an object of our indignation as the hero is an object
of our sympathy and affection. We detest Iago as much as we
esteem Othello; and we delight as much in Iago’s punishment
as we grieve over Othello’s distress. But although we have
such a strong fellow-feeling with the injuries that are done
to our brethren, it’s not always the case that our resentment
grows if the sufferer’s grows. ·On the contrary·, the •greater
his patience, mildness, and humaneness, the •greater our
resentment against the person who injured him—provided
that his patience etc. doesn’t seem to show that he is afraid
or that he lacks spirit. The likeableness of the sufferer’s
character intensiﬁes our sense of the atrocity of the injury.
However, those passions are regarded as necessary ele-
ments in human nature. A person becomes contemptible if

18

Smith on Moral Sentiments

The unsocial passions

he tamely sits still and submits to insults without trying to
repel or revenge them. We can’t enter into his indifference
and insensibility. We regard his behaviour as mean-spirited,
and are really provoked by it, just as much as we are by the
insolence of his adversary. Even the mob are enraged to see
any man submit patiently to insults and bullying. They want
to see this insolence resented by the person who suffers from
it. They angrily cry to him to defend or revenge himself. If
his indignation eventually bubbles up, they heartily applaud,
and sympathize with it. It enlivens their own indignation
against his enemy, whom they rejoice to see him attack in
his turn; and provided his revenge is not immoderate, they
are as really gratiﬁed by it as they would be if the injury had
been done to themselves.

•Those passions are useful to the individual, because they
make it dangerous to insult or injure him; and, as I’ll show
later, •they are useful to the public as guardians of justice
and of the equality of its administration; and yet •they have
in themselves something disagreeable that makes it natural
for us to dislike seeing them in other people. Suppose that
we are in company, and someone insults me; if I express
anger that goes beyond merely indicating that I noted the
insult, that is regarded not only as an insult to him but also
as a rudeness to the whole company. Respect for them
ought to have restrained me from giving way to such a
rowdy and offensive emotion.
It’s the •remote effects of
these passions that are agreeable; the •immediate effects
are mischief to the person against whom they are directed
[Smith’s phrase]. But what makes an object—·a passion or
anything else·—agreeable or disagreeable to the imagination
is its •immediate effect, not its •remote ones. A prison
is certainly more useful to the public than a palace; and
someone who establishes a prison is generally directed by a
much sounder spirit of patriotism than someone who builds

a palace. But the immediate effect of a prison—namely, the
conﬁnement of the wretches shut up in it—is disagreeable;
and the imagination either doesn’t bother to trace out the
remote consequences, or sees them from too great a distance
to be much affected by them. So a prison will always be
a disagreeable object; and the ﬁtter it is for its intended
purpose the more disagreeable it will be. A palace, on the
other hand, will always be agreeable; and yet its remote
effects may often be thoroughly bad for the public—e.g. pro-
moting luxury, and setting an example of the dissolution of
manners. [In Smith’s day, ‘luxury’ stood for very excessive indulgence
in physical comforts; see note on page 162.]. . . . Paintings or models
of the instruments of music or of agriculture make a common
and an agreeable ornament of our halls and dining-rooms.
A display of that kind composed of the instruments of
surgery—dissecting and amputation-knives, saws for cutting
the bones, trepanning instruments, etc.—would be absurd
and shocking. Yet instruments of surgery are always more
ﬁnely polished, and usually more exactly adapted to their
intended purpose, than instruments of agriculture. And
their •remote effect—the health of the patient—is agreeable.
But because their •immediate effect is pain and suffering,
the sight of them always displeases us. [Smith adds that
swords and such are liked, associated with courage etc.,
and even wanted as fashion accessories. It’s true that their
immediate effects are pain and suffering, but only for ‘our
enemies, with whom we have no sympathy’. He continues:] It
is the same with the qualities of the mind. The ancient stoics
held that because the world was governed by the all-ruling
providence of a wise, powerful, and good God, every single
event ought to be regarded as a necessary part of the plan
of the universe, and as tending to promote the general order
and happiness of the whole; so that men’s vices and follies
were as necessary a part of this plan as their wisdom or

19

Smith on Moral Sentiments

The unsocial passions

their virtue. . . . No theory of this sort, however, no matter
how deeply it might be rooted in the mind, could lessen our
natural abhorrence for vice, whose immediate effects are
so destructive and whose remote ones are too distant to be
traced by the imagination.

It’s the same with hatred and resentment. Their immedi-
ate effects are so disagreeable that even when the sufferer is
absolutely entitled to them there’s still something about them
that disgusts us. That’s why these are the only passions
that we aren’t inclined to sympathize with until we learn
about the cause that arouses them. ·In contrast with that·,
the plaintive •voice of misery, when heard at a distance,
won’t let us be indifferent about the person from whom it
comes; as soon as we hear •it we are concerned about his
fortune, and if •it continues it almost forces us to rush to
his assistance. The sight of a smiling face elevates even a
brooding person into a cheerful and airy mood that disposes
him to sympathize with the joy it expresses; and he feels his
heart, which just then had been shrunk and depressed by
thought and care, instantly expanded and elated. [Smith
goes on at colourful length about the different effect on us of
expressions of hatred and resentment. He concludes:] Grief
powerfully •engages and attracts us to the person who is
grieving; and hatred and resentment, while we are ignorant of
their cause, equally powerfully •disgust and detach us from
the person who has them. It seems to have been Nature’s
intention that the rougher and more dislikeable emotions
that drive men apart should be less easily and more rarely
passed on from man to man.

When music imitates the modulations of grief or joy, it
inspires us with those passions, or at least puts us in a
mood that disposes us to have them. But when it imitates
the notes of anger, it inspires us ·not with anger but· with
fear. Joy, grief, love, admiration, devotion, are all naturally

musical passions. Their natural tones are all soft, clear, and
melodious; and they naturally express themselves in phrases
that are separated by regular pauses, which makes it easy to
adapt them to them to the words of a song. In contrast with
this, the voice of anger and of all the passions like it is harsh
and discordant. Its phrases are all irregular, some long and
others short, and not marked off by regular pauses. So it is
hard for music to imitate any of those passions; and music
that does so isn’t the most agreeable. There would be no
impropriety in making a complete concert out of imitations
of the social and agreeable passions. It would be a strange
entertainment that consisted of nothing but imitations of
hatred and resentment!

Those passions are as disagreeable to the person who
feels them as they are to the spectator. •Hatred and •anger
are the greatest poison to the happiness of a good mind. In
the very feel of them there is something harsh, jarring, and
convulsive, something that tears and distracts the breast
and is altogether destructive of the calmness of mind that
is so necessary to happiness and is best promoted by the
contrary passions of •gratitude and •love. What generous
and humane people are most apt to regret ·when they are
injured· is not the value of what they lose by the perﬁdy and
ingratitude of those they live with. Whatever they may have
lost, they can generally be happy without it. What disturbs
them most is the idea of perﬁdy and ingratitude exercised
towards themselves; and they regard the discordant and
disagreeable passions that this arouses as constituting the
chief part of the injury that they suffer.

What does it take for the gratiﬁcation of resentment to be
completely agreeable, and to make the spectator thoroughly
sympathize with our revenge? Well, the ﬁrst thing is that
the provocation must be such that if we didn’t somewhat
resent it we would be making ourselves contemptible and

from a sense of the propriety of resentment—·i.e.· from
a sense that mankind expect and require it of us—than
because we feel in ourselves the furies of that disagreeable
passion. With the passion of resentment—more than any
other of which the human mind is capable—we ought to ask
ourselves sceptically ‘Is it all right for me to feel this?’, letting
our indulgence in it be subject to careful consultation with
our natural sense of propriety, i.e. to diligent consideration
of what will be the sentiments of the cool and impartial
spectator. The only motive that can ennoble the expressions
of this disagreeable passion is magnanimity, i.e. a concern
to maintain our own rank and dignity in society. This motive
must characterize our whole style and deportment. These
must be plain, open, and direct; determined but not domi-
neering, and elevated without insolence; not only free from
petulance and low abusiveness, but generous, fair-minded,
and full of all proper regard even for the person who has
offended us. [In that sentence ‘fair-minded’ replaces Smith’s ‘candid’.
He always uses it with that meaning, which is quite remote from what

manner—without our laboriously making a special point
of it—that our passion hasn’t extinguished our humaneness,
and that if we answer the call to get revenge we do so with
reluctance, from necessity, and in consequence of great and
repeated provocations. When resentment is guarded and
qualiﬁed in this manner it can even count as generous [see
note on page 11] and noble.

Chapter 4: The social passions

I have just been discussing a set of passions that are on
most occasions ungraceful and disagreeable, being made so
·in large measure· by the •divided sympathy that they evoke.
Now we come to an opposite set of passions—ones that are
nearly always especially agreeable and becoming, being made
so by the •redoubled sympathy that they evoke. Generosity,
humaneness, kindness, compassion, mutual friendship and
esteem—all the social and benevolent affections—when ex-
pressed in someone’s face or behaviour, even towards people
who aren’t specially connected with ourselves, please us on
almost every occasion. The impartial spectator’s sympathy
with the person x who feels those passions exactly coincides
with his concern for the person y who is the object of them.
Just by being a man, the spectator is obliged to have a
concern for y’s happiness, and this concern enlivens his
fellow-feeling with x’s sentiments, which also aim at y’s
happiness. So we always have the strongest disposition
to sympathize with the benevolent affections. They strike us
as in every respect agreeable. We enter into the satisfaction
of the person who feels them and of the person who is the
object of them. Just as

being an object of hatred and indignation gives more
pain than all the evil that a brave man can fear from
his enemies,

so also

for a person with ﬁne and sensitive feelings, the aware-
ness that he is loved brings a satisfaction that does
more for his happiness than any ·practical· advantage
he can expect to derive from being loved.

The most detestable character is that of the person who takes
pleasure in sowing dissension among friends, turning their
most tender love into mortal hatred. But what makes this so

21

Smith on Moral Sentiments

The selﬁsh passions

atrocious? Is it that it deprives them of the trivial good turns
they might have expected from one another if friendship had
continued? ·Of course not·!
It’s the fact that it deprives
them of that friendship itself, robbing them of each other’s
affections, from which both derived so much satisfaction;
disturbing the harmony of their hearts and ending the happy
relations that had previously held between them. •These
affections, that harmony, these inter-relations, are felt—not
only by tender and delicate people but also by the roughest
ordinary folk—to be more important for happiness than all
the little services that could be expected to ﬂow from •them.
The sentiment of love is in itself agreeable to the person
who feels it. It soothes and calms his breast, and seems. . . .to
promote the healthy state of his constitution; and it is made
still more delightful by his awareness of the gratitude and
satisfaction that his love must arouse in the person who is
the object of it. Their mutual regard makes them happy with
one another, and this mutual regard, added to sympathy,
makes them agreeable to everyone else. Take the case of

a family where mutual love and esteem hold sway
throughout; where the parents and children are com-
panions for one another, with no differences except
what come from the children’s respectful affection
and the parents’ kind indulgence; where freedom and
fondness, mutual teasing and mutual kindness, show
that the brothers are not divided by any opposition
of their interests, or the sisters by any rivalry for
parental favour; and where everything presents us
with the idea of peace, cheerfulness, harmony, and
contentment.

What pleasure we get from seeing a family like that! Then
consider being a visitor to

a household in which jarring contention sets half of
the members against the other half; where, along with

the surface appearance of smoothness and good tem-
per, suspicious looks and sudden ﬂashes of passion
reveal the mutual jealousies that burn within them,
ready at any moment to burst out through all the
restraints that the presence of visitors imposes.

What an unpleasant experience that is!

The likeable passions, even when they are clearly exces-
sive, are never regarded with aversion. There’s something
agreeable even in the excess of friendship and humaneness.
The too tender mother, the too indulgent father, the too
generous and affectionate friend, may be looked on with a
sort of pity, though there’s love mixed in with it; and they
can never be regarded with hatred and aversion, or even
with contempt, except by the most brutal and worthless of
mankind. When we blame them for the extravagance of their
attachment, we always do it with concern, with sympathy
and kindness. [Smith goes on to say that our only regret
regarding any extreme case of the social passions is ‘that
it is unﬁt for the world because the world is unworthy of
it’, so that the person in question is too open to abuse and
ingratitude that he doesn’t deserve and couldn’t easily bear.
He contrasts this with our much more robust disapproval of
extreme hatred and resentment.]

Chapter 5: The selﬁsh passions

Besides those two opposite sets of passions, the social and
the unsocial, there’s a third that occupies a sort of middle
place between them:
it’s a kind of passion that is never
as graceful as the social passions sometimes are, or as
odious as the unsocial passions sometimes are. This third
set of passions consists of grief and joy that people have
on account of their own private good or bad fortune. Even
when excessive, these passions are never as disagreeable as

22

Smith on Moral Sentiments

The selﬁsh passions

excessive resentment,

•because no opposing sympathy can ever make us
want to oppose them,

and even when they are most suitable to their objects, these
passions are never as agreeable as impartial humanity and
just benevolence, because

•no double sympathy can ever make us want to
support them.

There’s this difference between grief and joy: we are generally
most disposed to sympathize with small joys and great
sorrows. A man who by some sudden stroke of luck is
instantly raised into a condition of life far above what he had
formerly lived in can be sure that the congratulations of his
best friends aren’t all perfectly sincere. An upstart—even if
he is of the greatest merit—is generally disagreeable to us,
and a sentiment of envy commonly prevents us from heartily
sympathizing with his joy.
If he has any judgment he is
aware of this, ·and conducts himself accordingly·. Instead
of appearing to be elated with his good fortune, he does
his best to smother his joy, and keep down the mental lift
he is getting, naturally, from his new circumstances. He
dresses as plainly as ever, and displays the same modesty
of behaviour that was suitable to him in his former station.
He redoubles his attention to his old friends, and tries more
than ever to be humble, attentive, and obliging. And this
is the behaviour that we most approve of in someone in
his situation—apparently because we look to him to have
more •sympathy with our envy and aversion to his happiness
than we have •sympathy with his happiness! He hardly ever
succeeds in all this. We suspect the sincerity of his humility,
and he grows weary of this constraint. Before long, he leaves
all his old friends behind him, except perhaps some of the
poorest of them, who are willing to lower themselves to the
level of becoming his dependents. And he doesn’t always

acquire new friends; the pride of his new acquaintances is as
much offended at ﬁnding him their equal as the pride of his
old ones had been offended by his becoming their superior;
and he’ll have to put up the most obstinate and persevering
·show of· modesty to atone for either offence. He generally
grows weary too soon, and is provoked by the sullen and
suspicious pride of his old friends to treat them with neglect,
by the saucy contempt of his new acquaintances to treat
them with petulance, until eventually he forms a habit of
insolence, and isn’t respected by anyone. If the chief part of
human happiness comes from the consciousness of being
beloved, as I think it does, these sudden changes of fortune
seldom contribute much to happiness. The happiest man is
one who advances more gradually to greatness, whose every
step upwards is widely predicted before he reaches it, so that
when his success comes it can’t arouse extravagant •joy in
himself, and can’t reasonably create •jealousy in those he
overtakes or •envy in those he leaves behind.

We are more apt to sympathize with smaller joys ﬂowing
from less imposing causes. It is decent to be humble amidst
great prosperity; but we can hardly overdo our expressions of
satisfaction in all the little occurrences of common life—the
company we had yesterday evening, the entertainment that
was provided for us, what was said and what was done, all
the little incidents of the present conversation, and all the
trivial nothings that ﬁll up the void of human life. Nothing is
more graceful than habitual cheerfulness, which is always
based on a special liking for all the little pleasures that
everyday events provide. We readily sympathize with it; it
inspires us with the same joy, and makes every triﬂe present
to us the same agreeable aspect that it presents to the person
endowed with this happy disposition. That is why youth,
the time of gaiety, so easily engages our affections. The
propensity for joy that seems. . . .to sparkle from the eyes of

The selﬁsh passions

youth and beauty—even in a person of the same sex—raises
even elderly people to a more joyous mood than ordinary.
They forget their inﬁrmities for a while, and give themselves
over to agreeable ideas and emotions to which they have
long been strangers, but which return to their breast when
the presence of so much happiness calls them back—like
old acquaintances from whom they are sorry to have ever
been parted, and whom they embrace all the more heartily
because of this long separation.

otherwise with grief. Small vexations arouse no sympathy,
but deep afﬂiction calls forth the greatest. The man who
is made uneasy by every little disagreeable incident. . . .will
seldom meet with much sympathy. [Smith builds into that
sentence sketches of eight such trivial incidents.] Joy is a
pleasant emotion, and we gladly give ourselves over to it on
the slightest occasion. So we readily sympathize with it in
others except when we are prejudiced by envy. But grief
is painful, and the mind naturally resists and recoils from
it—and that includes resisting being grieved by one’s own
misfortunes. We try either not to be grieved at all, or to
shake our grief off as soon as it comes over us. It’s true that
our aversion to grief won’t always stop us from grieving over
triﬂing troubles that we meet, but it constantly prevents us
from sympathizing with the grief that others have because

of similar trivial causes. ·How can there be that difference?·
It’s because our •sympathetic passions are always easier to
resist than our •original ones. Also, human nature includes
a malice that not only •prevents all sympathy with little
unhappinesses but •makes them somewhat amusing. Hence
the delight we all take in teasing, and in the small vexation
that we observe in our companion when he is pushed, and
urged, and teased on all sides. [Smith adds details about how
such matters are managed in society. A ‘man who lives in the
world’, he says, stays in tune with his social surroundings by
teasing himself regarding trivial calamities [Smith calls them
‘frivolous calamities’] that befall him.]

On the other side, our sympathy with deep distress is
strong and sincere. You don’t need me to give examples. We
weep even at the representation of a tragedy on the stage.
So if you are labouring under some notable calamity, if
through some extraordinary misfortune you have fallen into
poverty, disease, disgrace or ·major· disappointment, you
can generally depend on the sincerest sympathy of all your
friends, and on their kindest assistance too as far as their
interests and honour will permit; and that holds even if the
trouble was partly your own fault. But if your misfortune
is not of this dreadful kind, if you have merely been a little
blocked in your ambition, if you have only been jilted by
your mistress, or are only hen-pecked by your wife, you can
reckon on being teased by everyone you know!

Smith on Moral Sentiments

Joy/sympathy and sorrow/sympathy

Section 3: How prosperity and adversity affect our judgments about the rightness of actions; and why it is

easier to win our approval in prosperity than in adversity

Chapter 1: The intensity-difference between joy and
sympathy with joy is less than the intensity-difference
between sorrow and sympathy with sorrow

Our sympathy with sorrow has been more taken notice of
than our sympathy with joy, though it’s no more real than
that. The word ‘sympathy’, in its most strict and basic
meaning, denotes our fellow-feeling with the sufferings of
others, not with their enjoyments. . . .

Our sympathy with sorrow is in some sense more uni-
versal than our sympathy with joy. Even when sorrow is
excessive, we may still have some fellow-feeling with it. What
we feel then doesn’t amount to the complete sympathy, the
perfect harmony and matching of sentiments, that consti-
tutes approval. We don’t weep and exclaim and lament with
the sufferer. We’re conscious of his weakness and of the
extravagance of his passion, and yet we often have a deﬁnite
feeling of concern on his account. But if we don’t entirely
enter into and go along with a person’s joy, we have no
sort of regard or fellow-feeling for it. We have contempt
and indignation for the man who dances about with an
intemperate and senseless joy that we can’t accompany him
in.

It’s also relevant that pain, whether of mind or body, is a
more forceful [Smith: ‘pungent’] sensation than pleasure; and
our sympathy with pain, though it falls well short of what
is naturally felt by the sufferer, is usually a more lively and
distinct perception than our sympathy with pleasure, despite
the fact that our sympathy with pleasure often comes close
to the natural vivacity of the original passion.

Over and above all this, we often struggle to keep down

our sympathy with the sorrow of others. When we aren’t
in the presence of the sufferer we try for our own sakes to
suppress it as much as we can. We don’t always succeed,
·because· the opposition that we put up to sympathetic
sorrow and the reluctance with which we give in to it force
us to be more explicitly aware of it. In contrast, we never
have occasion to put up such opposition to our sympathy
with joy. Whenever there’s any envy in the case, we don’t
feel the slightest propensity towards joy; but if there’s no
envy we give way to joy without any reluctance. When we
are envious we are always ashamed of being so, which is
why we often say that we sympathize with someone’s joy
(and perhaps even wish we could do so) when we are really
disqualiﬁed from doing so by that disagreeable sentiment,
envy. We are glad about our neighbour’s good fortune, we
say, when in our hearts we may be really sorry. We often
feel sympathy with sorrow when we would prefer not to; and
we often don’t sympathize with joy when we would be glad
to do so. Given all these facts, it is natural to be led to the
conclusion that our propensity to sympathize with sorrow
must be very strong, and our inclination to sympathize with
joy very weak.

Despite this snap judgment, however, I venture to say that
when no envy is involved our propensity to sympathize with
joy is much stronger than our propensity to sympathize with
sorrow; and that our fellow-feeling for the agreeable emotion
comes much closer to the liveliness of what is naturally felt
by rejoicing person than our fellow-feeling for someone’s
sorrow comes to his own sorrow.

We somewhat indulge excessive grief that we can’t entirely

25

Smith on Moral Sentiments

Joy/sympathy and sorrow/sympathy

go along with. We know what an enormous effort it takes for
the sufferer to bring his emotion down to a level of complete
harmony with what the spectator feels. So if he fails in
that, it’s easy for us to pardon him. But we have no such
indulgence for intemperate joy, because we have no sense
that any such vast effort is needed to bring that down to what
we ·spectators· can entirely enter into. The man who can
command his sorrow under the greatest calamities seems
worthy of the highest admiration; but someone who can
master his joy in the fullness of prosperity seems hardly to
deserve any praise. The gap between •what is naturally felt
by the person principally concerned and •what the spectator
can entirely go along with is much wider with sorrow than
with joy; and we’re aware of that.

If a man has good health, is out of debt, and has a
clear conscience, what can he added to his happiness? All
increases of fortune for such a man can properly be said to
be superﬂuous, and if he is much elated by them that must
be an effect of the most frivolous levity. Yet •this situation
may well be called the natural and ordinary state of mankind.
Despite the present misery and depravity of the world, so
rightly lamented, •this really is the state of the majority of
men. So we get the result: most men can’t ﬁnd any great
difﬁculty in raising themselves ·sympathetically· to the level
of joy that someone else has through having come into this
happy state.

But though little can be added to this state (·of good
health, freedom from debt, and possession of a clear con-
science·), much can be taken from it. There’s only a trivial
gap between this condition and the highest pitch of human
prosperity, but between it and the lowest depth of misery
the distance is immense. Thus, adversity depresses the
sufferer’s mind much further below its natural state than
prosperity can raise it above that state. So the spectator

must •ﬁnd it much harder to sympathize entirely with his
sorrow, keeping perfect time with it, than to enter thoroughly
into his joy, and must •depart much further from his own
natural and ordinary state of mind in the one case than in
the other. That’s why our sympathy with sorrow, despite
being a more forceful sensation than our sympathy with joy,
always falls further short than the latter does of the intensity
of what is naturally felt by the person principally concerned.
Sympathy with joy is a pleasure, and as long as envy
doesn’t oppose it our heart is glad to abandon itself to the
highest transports of that delightful sentiment. But it is
painful to go along with grief, and we always enter into that
with reluctance. When we are watching a dramatic tragedy,
we struggle as long as we can against the sympathetic sorrow
that the entertainment inspires, and eventually give way to
it only when we can no longer avoid it. And even then we try
to cover our concern from those we are with; if we shed any
tears we carefully conceal them, for fear that the others, not
entering into this excessive tenderness themselves, might
regard it as effeminacy and weakness. . . .

Why should we be more ashamed to weep than to laugh
when we are in company? We may often have as much reason
to weep as to laugh, but we always feel that the spectators
are more likely to go along with us in the agreeable emotion
than in the painful one. . . .

How hearty are the acclamations of the mob, who are
never envious of their superiors, at a triumphal parade!
And how sedate and moderate, usually, is their grief at an
execution! Our sorrow at a funeral generally amounts to
nothing but a pretended gravity, but our happiness at a
christening or a marriage is always from the heart, with no
pretence. On all such joyous occasions our satisfaction is
often as lively as that of the persons principally concerned,
though perhaps not as durable. [Smith adds details about

26

Smith on Moral Sentiments

Ambition, rank

our physical appearance during such bouts of sympathetic
pleasure.]

Whereas when we condole with our friends in their afﬂic-
tions, how little we feel in comparison with what they feel!
[Smith adds details, including the remark that our relative
lack of real sympathy may produce guilt, which makes us]
work ourselves up into an artiﬁcial sympathy;. . . .but as soon
as we have left the room this vanishes and is gone for ever.
It seems that when Nature loaded us with our own sorrows,
she thought that they were enough, and therefore didn’t
command us to take any share other people’s sorrows except
for what is necessary to prompt us to help them.

[There follow two long rapturous paragraphs in praise of
‘magnanimity amidst great distress’, with poetic praise for
the serene suicides of Cato and Socrates. Then:]

In contrast with this, anyone who is sunk in sorrow and
dejection because of some calamity that has befallen him
always appears somewhat mean and despicable. We can’t
bring ourselves to feel for him what he feels for himself,
even though we might feel it for ourselves if we were in his
situation. So perhaps it is unjust of us to despise him, if any
sentiment can regarded as unjust when nature compels us to
have it. There’s never anything agreeable about the weakness
of sorrow, except when it arises from what we feel for others
more than from what we feel for ourselves. A son whose
kindly and respectworthy father has died may give way to
sorrow without much blame. His sorrow is mainly based on
a sort of sympathy with his departed parent, and we readily
enter into this humane emotion. But if he were to indulge
the same weakness on account of a misfortune that affected
only himself, we would no longer be patient with him. If he
were reduced to beggary and ruin, if he were exposed to the
most dreadful dangers, indeed if he were led out to a public
execution and there shed one single tear on the scaffold,

he would disgrace himself for ever in the minds of all the
gallant and generous part of mankind. [Re ‘generous’, see note
on page 11.] Their compassion for him would be strong and
sincere; but because it would still fall short of his excessive
weakness they would not pardon his thus exposing himself
in the eyes of the world. His behaviour would affect them
with shame rather than with sorrow; and the dishonour that
he had thus [i.e. by weeping on the scaffold] brought on himself
would appear to them the most lamentable circumstance in
his misfortune. . . .

Chapter 2: The origin of ambition, and differences of
rank

It is because mankind are disposed to sympathize more
entirely with our joy than with our sorrow that we parade
our riches and conceal our poverty. Nothing is so humiliating
as having to expose our distress to the public view, and to
feel that although our situation is there for everyone to see,
no-one feels for us a half of what we feel. Indeed, this concern
for the sentiments of everyone else is the main reason why
we pursue riches and avoid poverty. Consider: what is the
purpose of all the toil and bustle of this world? What is the
purpose of avarice and ambition, of the pursuit of wealth,
power, and pre-eminence? Is it to supply the necessities
of nature? The wages of the poorest labourer can supply
them: his means afford him food and clothing, and the
comfort of a house and of a family. If we strictly examined
his personal budget we would ﬁnd that he spends a great
part of his income on conveniences that can be regarded as
luxuries. . . . Why, then, are we so concerned to avoid being
in his situation, and why should those who have grown up
in the higher ranks of life regard it as worse than death to be
reduced to live—even without his labour—on the same simple

27

Smith on Moral Sentiments

Ambition, rank

food as he eats, to dwell under the same lowly roof, and to be
dressed in the same humble clothes? Do they imagine that
their stomach is better or their sleep sounder in a palace
than in a cottage? The contrary of this has often been pointed
out, and anyway it is so obvious that everyone would know
it even if no-one had pointed it out! Well, then, what is the
source of that emulation—·that trying-to-copy·—that runs
through all the different ranks of men? What advantages
do we expect from that great purpose of human life that
we call ‘bettering our condition’? The only advantages we
can aim to derive from it are being noticed, attended to,
regarded with sympathy, acceptance, and approval.
It is
the vanity—not the ease or the pleasure—that draws us.
But vanity is always based on our thinking we are the
object of attention and approval. The rich man glories in
his riches because he feels that •they naturally attract the
world’s attention to him, and that •mankind are disposed
to go along with him in all the agreeable emotions that the
advantages of his situation so readily inspire in him. At
the thought of this his heart seems to swell within him,
and he is fonder of his wealth on this account than for all
the other advantages it brings him. The poor man, on the
other hand, is ashamed of his poverty. He feels that either
•it places him out of everyone’s sight or •if people do take
any notice of him it’s with almost no fellow-feeling for the
misery and distress that he suffers. He is humiliated on both
accounts. Being disapproved of is entirely different from
being overlooked, ·but being overlooked is essentially tied
to not being approved of·: the obscurity of the overlooked
poor man also shuts out the daylight of honour and approval;
so that his feeling of not being taken notice of necessarily
damps the most agreeable hope and disappoints the most
ardent desire of human nature, ·namely, the desire for the
approval of one’s fellow-men·. The poor man comes and goes

unheeded, and is no more noticed in the middle of a crowd
than he is when shut up in his own hovel. The humble cares
and earnest work that occupy people in his situation don’t
entertain the dissipated and the cheerful. They avert their
eyes from him, or if his distress is so extreme that they have
to look at him, it’s only to keep themselves at a distance from
such a disagreeable object. Those who are fortunate and
proud are amazed that human wretchedness should dare to
present itself before them, having the insolence to disturb
the serenity of their happiness with the loathsome view of
its misery. The man of rank and distinction, on the other
hand, is observed by all the world. Everyone is eager to look
at him, and to have, if only through sympathy, the joy and
exultation that his circumstances naturally inspire in him.
The public care about what he does—about his every word,
every gesture. In a large assembly he is the person everyone
looks at, waiting for him to start and direct their passions;
and if his behaviour isn’t altogether absurd, every moment
gives him an opportunity to interest mankind, and to make
himself an object of the observation and fellow-feeling of
everyone around him. This •attention imposes restraints on
him—greatness always brings a certain loss of liberty—and
yet •it makes greatness an object of envy, and everyone
thinks that it compensates for all the toil and anxiety involved
in the pursuit of it, and (even more signiﬁcant) all the leisure,
ease, and carefree security that are lost for ever by the
acquisition of greatness.

When we consider the condition of the great in the
delusive colours in which the imagination is apt to paint
it, it seems to be almost the abstract idea of a perfect and
happy state. It is exactly the state that we in our daydreams
had sketched out to ourselves as the ultimate object of all
our desires. That gives us a special sympathy with the
satisfaction of those who are in that state. We favour all

28

Smith on Moral Sentiments

Ambition, rank

their inclinations, and support all their wishes. What a pity
it would be (we think) if anything were to spoil and corrupt
such an agreeable situation! We could even wish them to
be immortal; and it seems hard to us that death should at
last put an end to such perfect enjoyment. . . . Great King,
live for ever! is the Asian compliment that we would readily
offer them if experience didn’t teach us its absurdity.
[In
the original, as well as in this version, the preceding sentence has the
ﬁrst occurrence of ‘king’ in this work.] Every calamity that befalls
them, every injury that is done them, arouses in the breast
of the spectator ten times more compassion and resentment
than he would have felt if the same things had happened
to other men. The only proper subjects for tragedy are
the misfortunes of kings. In this respect they resemble the
misfortunes of lovers. Those two situations are the ones
that chieﬂy interest us in the theatre; because, in spite of
everything that reason and experience can tell us to the
contrary, the prejudices of the imagination attach to these
two states a happiness superior to any other. To disturb or
to put an end to such perfect enjoyment seems to be the
most atrocious of all injuries. . . . All the innocent blood that
was shed in the civil wars provoked less indignation than
the death of Charles I. A stranger to human nature who
saw •men’s indifference to the misery of their inferiors and
•the regret and indignation they feel for the misfortunes of
those above them might well think that pain must be more
agonizing, and the convulsions of death more terrible, for
persons of higher rank than for those lower down in the
scale.

Mankind’s disposition to go along with all the passions
of the rich and the powerful is the basis for the ordering of
society into different ranks. Our fawning deference to our
superiors comes from our admiration for the advantages of

their situation more often than it comes from any individual’s
expecting beneﬁt from their good-will. Their beneﬁts can
extend to only a few, but their fortunes are a matter of
concern to almost everyone. We’re eager to help them to
complete a system of happiness that comes so near to
perfection; and we want to serve them for their own sake,
without any reward but the honour of obliging them. Nor is
our deference to the wishes of people of high rank primarily
based on a concern for the usefulness of •such submission,
a concern for the social order that is best supported by •it.
Even when the order of society seems to require that we
should oppose the high-ranking people, we can hardly bring
ourselves to do it. Consider the doctrine that

kings are the servants of the people, who are to be
obeyed, resisted, deposed, or punished as the public
convenience may require;

—that is the doctrine of reason and philosophy, but it isn’t the
doctrine of Nature! Nature would teach us to submit to kings
for their own sake, to tremble and bow down before their
high station, to regard their smile as a sufﬁcient reward for
any services, and to dread their displeasure—even if no other
evil were to follow from it—as the severest of all humiliations.
To treat them in any way as men, to reason and argue with
them on ordinary occasions, requires a strength of character
that few men have. . . . The strongest motives—the most
furious •passions of fear, hatred, and resentment—are hardly
enough to outweigh this natural disposition to respect them.
For the bulk of the people to be willing to oppose a king
with violence, or to want to see him punished or deposed,
he’ll have to have aroused in them—innocently or not—the
highest degree of all •those passions. Even when the people
have been brought this far, they are still apt to relent at any
moment; they easily relapse into their habitual deference
towards someone they have been accustomed to look on as

29

Smith on Moral Sentiments

Ambition, rank

their natural superior. They can’t bear seeing their monarch
humiliated. Resentment gives way to compassion; they forget
all past provocations, their old drives towards loyalty start
up again, and they run to re-establish the ruined authority
of their old masters with the same violence with which they
had opposed it. The death ·by beheading· of Charles I ( ·after
the civil war of the 1640s·) brought about the restoration
of the royal family. Compassion for James II when he was
seized by the populace in making his escape on ship-board
nearly prevented the revolution ·of 1688·, and did slow it
down.

Do the great seem unaware of how easily they can get
the admiration of the public? or do they seem to think
that, for them as for anyone else, their rank must have
been purchased either by sweat or by blood? If the young
nobleman is instructed in how to support the dignity of
his rank, and to make himself worthy of the superiority
over his fellow-citizens that he has acquired through the
virtue of his ancestors, what accomplishments is he told to
acquire for this purpose? Is he to make himself worthy of
his rank by knowledge, hard work, patience, self-denial, or
any other kind of virtue? Because his least move is noticed,
he acquires a habit of care over every detail of ordinary
behaviour, and tries to perform all those small duties with
the most exact propriety. Being conscious of how much he
is observed, and of how much people are disposed to allow
him to have whatever he wants, he acts—even in utterly
ordinary situations—with the freedom and loftiness that are
naturally inspired by the thought of how the populace view
him. Everything about his conduct marks an elegant and
graceful sense of his own superiority—something that those
who are born lower down the social scale can hardly ever
achieve. These are the arts [here = ‘the devices’ or even ‘the tricks’]
by which he proposes to make mankind more easily submit

to his authority and govern their inclinations according to
his wishes; and in this he usually succeeds. . . . During most
of his reign Louis XIV ·of France· was widely regarded as the
most perfect model of a great prince. What were the talents
and virtues by which he acquired this great reputation?
The scrupulous and inﬂexible rightness—the danger and
difﬁculty—the tireless energy—of everything he did? His
broad knowledge, his exquisite judgment, his heroic valour?
It was none of these. What he did have was the status of the
most powerful prince in Europe, which gave him the highest
rank among kings; and then, says his historian. . . [and
Smith gives a long quotation about Louis XIV’s grand and
imposing personal manner, his ﬁne voice, his handsomeness,
and so on. Then:] These trivial accomplishments—supported
by his rank and no doubt by a degree of other talents and
virtues, though not an outstanding degree—established this
prince in the esteem of his own age and later generations’
respect for his memory. Compared with this kingly manner,
no other virtue appeared to have any merit. . . .

But a man of lower rank can’t hope to distinguish himself
in any such way as that. Polish [Smith’s word is ‘politeness’] is so
much a virtue of the great that it won’t bring much honour to
anyone else. The fool who imitates their manner, pretending
to be eminent by the extreme properness of his ordinary
behaviour, is rewarded with a double share of contempt for
his •folly and •presumption. [Smith goes on a bit about the
absurdity of pretentious behaviour in ordinary low-ranked
people. Then:] The behaviour of a private man ought to be
marked by perfect modesty and plainness, along with as
much casualness as is consistent with the respect due to
the people he is with. If he hopes ever to distinguish himself,
it will have to be by more important virtues. He’ll have to
acquire dependents to match the dependents of the great;
and because his only access to funds from which to support

30

Smith on Moral Sentiments

Ambition, rank

them will be through the labour of his body and the activity
of his mind, he’ll have to cultivate these. So he’ll need to
acquire superior knowledge in his profession, and to work
unusually hard in the exercise of it. He must be patient
in labour, resolute in danger, and ﬁrm in distress. He’ll
have bring these talents into public view by the difﬁculty
and importance of his undertakings, by the good judgment
and the severe and unrelenting application with which he
pursues them. His behaviour in all ordinary circumstances
must be marked by honesty and prudence, generosity and
frankness; and he must give priority to activities in which it
requires the greatest talents and virtues to act properly, but
in which the greatest applause goes to those who can acquit
themselves with honour. ·Consider these two portraits·:

(1) When the man of spirit and ambition is depressed
by his situation, how impatiently he looks around
for some great opportunity to distinguish himself!
He won’t turn down anything that can provide him
with this. He even looks forward with satisfaction
to the prospect of foreign war, or civil war ·in his
own country·; with secret delight he sees—through
all the confusion and bloodshed that wars bring—the
probability of getting into some of those wished-for
occasions in which he can attract the attention and
admiration of mankind.

(2) The man of rank and distinction, •whose whole glory
consists in the propriety of his ordinary behaviour,
•who is contented with the humble renown that this
can bring him, and •who has no talents to acquire any
other ·distinction·, is unwilling to risk embarrassing
himself in any activity that might turn out to be
difﬁcult or distressing. To cut a ﬁne ﬁgure at a ball
is his great triumph, and to succeed in a romantic
intrigue is his highest exploit. He hates all public

confusions, not •because he loves mankind (the great
never look on their inferiors as fellow-men) and not
•because he lacks courage (for he usually doesn’t),
but •because he is aware that he doesn’t have any of
the virtues that are required in such situations, and
that the public attention will certainly be drawn away
from him towards by others. He may be willing to
expose himself to some small danger, or to conduct
a military campaign when that happens to be the
fashion. But he shudders with horror at the thought
of any situation that would demand the continual
and long exertion of patience, industry, strength, and
application of thought.

Those virtues are hardly ever to be found in men who are
born to high ranks. That is why in all governments—even
in monarchies—the highest administrative positions are
generally occupied, and the detailed administrative work
done, by men who were brought up in the middle and
lower social ranks, who have advanced through their own
hard work and abilities, although they are loaded with the
jealousy and opposed by the resentment of all those who
were born their superiors. The great—·those with the very
highest social rank·—at ﬁrst regard these administrators as
negligible, then they come to envy them, and eventually they
are contented to knuckle under to them in the same abjectly
low manner that they want the rest of mankind to adopt
towards themselves.

It’s the loss of this easy command over the affections of
mankind that makes the fall from greatness so unbearable.
[Smith gives a rather full account of one example, the family
of the defeated king of Macedon who were led in triumph
through Rome. The crowd, he reports, were deeply moved by
the sight of the children, but were contemptuous of the king
because he had chosen to stay alive and endure this disgrace.

31

Smith on Moral Sentiments

Ambition, rank

The disgrace, Smith says sharply, was to spend the rest of
his life in comfort and safety, on a generous pension. What
he had lost was ‘the admiring mob of fools, ﬂatterers, and
dependents who had formerly been accustomed to attend to
everything he did’.]

‘Love’, says Rochefoucauld, ‘is often followed by ambition,
but ambition is hardly ever followed by love.’ Once the pas-
sion of ambition has taken possession of the breast, it won’t
allow any rival or any successor. To those who have been
accustomed to having or even hoping for public admiration,
all other pleasures sicken and die. Some fallen statesmen
have tried to become happier by working to overcome their
ambition, and to despise the honours that they could no
longer have; but how few have been able to succeed! Most of
them have spent their time in listless and insipid laziness,
•angry at the thought of their own insigniﬁcance, •unable to
take an interest in the occupations of private life, •enjoying
nothing but talk about their former greatness, •satisﬁed in
no activity except pointless attempts to recover that. Are
you sincerely determined never to barter your liberty for the
lordly servitude of a court, but to live free, fearless, and
independent? Here is one way to keep to that virtuous
resolution, and it may be the only one: Never enter the place
from which so few have been able to return, never come
within the circle of ambition, and never compare yourself
with those masters of the earth who have already occupied
the attention of half of mankind before you.

[Smith’s next paragraph starts with some rather obscure
remarks about people’s attitude to ‘place’, which he distin-
guishes from ‘rank’. He continues:] But no-one despises
rank, distinction, pre-eminence, unless he is either vastly
•better than the human average or vastly •worse, i.e. unless
he is either

•so conﬁrmed in wisdom and real philosophy that

he is convinced that as long as the propriety of his
conduct entitles him to approval it doesn’t matter
much whether people notice him or approve of him,

or else

•so habituated to the idea of his own low condition, so
sunk in slothful and sottish indifference, that he has
entirely forgotten the desire. . . .for superiority.

What gives to prosperity all its dazzling splendour is the
prospect of being a natural object of the joyous congratu-
lations and sympathetic attention of mankind; and, corre-
spondingly, what makes the gloom of adversity so horribly
dark is the feeling that our misfortunes are objects (not
of the fellow-feeling, but) of the contempt and aversion of
our brethren.
It’s because of this that the most dreadful
calamities aren’t always the ones that it is hardest to bear.
It is often more humiliating to appear in public under small
disasters than under great misfortunes. The small ones
arouse no sympathy, whereas the great calamities evoke a
lively compassion. Although in the latter case the spectators’
sympathetic feelings aren’t as lively as the anguish of the
sufferer, the gap between sufferer and spectator is smaller
in those cases than in the case of small misfortunes, so that
the spectator’s imperfect fellow-feeling does give the sufferer
some help in bearing his misery. It would be more humil-
iating for a gentleman to appear at a social event covered
with ﬁlth and rags than to appear with blood and wounds.
The latter situation would draw people’s pity, whereas the
other would make them laugh. The judge who orders a
criminal to be set in the pillory dishonours him more than if
he had condemned him to the scaffold. [Smith adds some
remarks about (dis)honour, apparently connecting it with the
(un)likelihood of attracting pity. Then:] That’s why persons
of high rank are never subjected to lesser punishments: the
law often takes their life, but it almost always respects their

32

Smith on Moral Sentiments

Admiring the rich etc.

honour. To ﬂog such a person or to set him in the pillory,
on account of any crime whatever, is a brutality of which no
European government is capable—except Russia’s.

A brave man isn’t made contemptible by being brought
to the scaffold; he is, by being set in the pillory. His
behaviour on the scaffold may gain him universal esteem
and admiration, whereas nothing he can do in the pillory
can make him agreeable. The sympathy of the spectators
supports him on the scaffold, saving him from the most
unbearable of all sentiments, namely the shameful sense
that his misery is felt by no-one but himself. There is no
sympathy for the man in the pillory; or if there is any it’s
not sympathy with •his pain, which is a triﬂe, but sympathy
with •his awareness of not getting any sympathy because of
his pain. Those who pity him blush and hang down their
heads for him. He droops in the same way, and feels himself
irrecoverably degraded by the punishment, though not by
the crime.
In contrast with this, the man who dies with
resolution is naturally regarded with esteem and approval by
spectators who have their heads up, and he keeps his head
up too; and if the crime doesn’t deprive him of the respect
of others, the punishment never will. He has no suspicion
that his situation is an object of contempt or derision to
anyone, and he is entitled to assume the air not only of
perfect calmness but of triumph and exultation. . . .

Chapter 3: The corruption of our moral sentiments that
comes from this disposition to admire the rich and the
great, and to despise or neglect the downtrodden and
poor

This disposition to admire—and almost to worship—the rich
and the powerful, and to despise or at least neglect persons
of poor and mean condition, is (on one hand) necessary to
establish and maintain the distinction of ranks and the order
of society, and (on the other) the great and most universal
cause of the corruption of our moral sentiments. Moralists
all down the centuries have complained that wealth and
greatness are often given the respect and admiration that
only wisdom and virtue should receive, and that poverty and
weakness are quite wrongly treated with the contempt that
should be reserved for vice and folly.

We want to be respected and to be worthy of respect. We’re
afraid of being contemned and of being contemptible. But as
we move into the world we soon ﬁnd that wisdom and virtue
are by no means the only objects of respect, and that vice
and folly aren’t the only objects of contempt. We often see the
world’s respectful attentions directed more strongly towards
the rich and great than towards the wise and virtuous. We
often see the vices and follies of the powerful much less
despised than the poverty and weakness of the innocent. For
us to further our great ambition to enjoy the respect and
admiration of mankind, two different roads are presented
to us, each leading to the desired goal: (1) the acquisition
of wealth and greatness, and (2) the study of wisdom and
the practice of virtue. Two different characters are presented
for us to try to achieve: (1) proud ambition and ostentatious
greed, and (2) humble modesty and fairness of conduct. Two
different pictures are held out to us as models on which we
can try to shape our own character and behaviour: (1) one

33

Smith on Moral Sentiments

Admiring the rich etc.

is gaudy and glittering in its colouring, (2) the other is more
correct and more exquisitely beautiful in its outline; (1) one
forces itself on the notice of every wandering eye, (2) the
other doesn’t attract much attention from anyone but the
most studious and careful observer. (1) The admirers and
worshippers of wealth and greatness are the great mob of
mankind (and how odd it seems that most of them aren’t
in this camp because they hope to get anything out of it).
(2) The real and steady admirers of wisdom and virtue are
mostly wise and virtuous themselves; they’re a select group,
but not a large one, I’m afraid. The two •objects of respect
produce two •kinds of respect; it’s not hard to tell them apart,
and yet they have a great deal in common, so that inattentive
observers are apt to mistake the one for the other, i.e. to
observe a case of respect for wealth and greatness and to
mistake it for a case of respect for wisdom and virtue.

Almost everyone respects the rich and great more than
the poor and the humble. [Smith starts that sentence with ‘In equal
degrees of merit. . . ’, which suggests that his point might be: If a rich
man is morally on a par with a poor one, nearly everyone will give the
rich one more respect. But the rest of the paragraph doesn’t suggest any
concern with moral equality across differences of rank.] With most
men the presumption and vanity of the rich are much more
admired than the real and solid merit of the poor. It is hardly
agreeable to good morals, indeed it seems like an abuse of
language, to say

‘Mere wealth and greatness, abstracted from merit
and virtue, deserve our respect.’

But we have to admit that wealth and greatness so constantly
get respect that they can be considered as in some ways the
natural objects of it. The status of someone who is wealthy
and great can be completely degraded by vice and folly, but
it takes an enormous intensity of vice and folly to do this.
The extravagance of a man of fashion is looked on with much

less contempt and aversion than that of a man lower down
the social scale. One breach of the rules of temperance and
propriety by a poor man is commonly more resented than
the constant and open disregard of those rules ever is in a
rich man.

In the middling and lower stations of life, the road to
virtue is happily pretty much the same as the road to fortune,
in most cases; I’m talking here about the kind of fortune
that men in such ·lower· stations can reasonably expect
to acquire. In all the middling and lower professions, it’s
nearly always possible to succeed through real and solid
professional abilities combined with prudent, just, ﬁrm, and
temperate conduct. And sometimes abilities will bring suc-
cess even when the conduct is far from correct. But habitual
imprudence will always cloud and sometimes submerge the
most splendid professional abilities, and so can injustice,
weakness, and extravagance. ·That’s one consideration that
tends to keep· men who are in the lower or middling stations
of life ·behaving properly. And there are two others: •Such
men· can never be great enough to be above the law, and
that inevitably overawes them into some sort of respect for
the rules of justice, or at least the more important of them.
•And the success of such people nearly always depends on
the favour and good opinion of their neighbours and equals,
and that can seldom be had unless their conduct is tolerably
regular [i.e. pretty much in accordance with the rules]. So the good
old proverb that honesty is the best policy holds true here;
and we can generally expect a considerable degree of virtue
in such situations, which are (fortunately for the good morals
of society!) the situations that the vast majority of mankind
are in.

In the upper stations of life the case is not, unfortunately,
always like that. In the courts of princes and in the drawing-
rooms of the great, success and advancement depend not

34

Smith on Moral Sentiments

Admiring the rich etc.

on the esteem of intelligent and well-informed equals but on
the fanciful and foolish favour of ignorant, presumptuous,
and proud superiors; and ﬂattery and falsehood too often
prevail over merit and abilities. In such societies the ability
to please is valued above the ability to serve. In times of
peace a prince or great man wishes only to be amused, and
is even apt to imagine •that he has almost no need for service
from anyone, or •that those who amuse him are sufﬁciently
able to serve him. The trivial accomplishments of. . . .a man
of fashion are commonly more admired than the solid and
masculine virtues of a warrior, a statesman, a philosopher,
or a legislator. All the great and awe-inspiring virtues—the
ones that can equip a man for the council, the senate, or
the battleﬁeld—are regarded with the utmost contempt and
derision by the insolent and insigniﬁcant ﬂatterers who
commonly loom largest in such corrupted societies. When
the duke of Sully was called on by Louis XIII to give his advice
in a great emergency, he noticed the courtiers giggling to
one another about his unfashionable appearance. ‘Whenever
your majesty’s father’, said the old warrior and statesman,
‘did me the honour to consult me, he ordered the buffoons
of the court to leave the room.’

It’s because of our disposition to admire and therefore to
imitate the rich and the great that they are able to set fash-
ions—in dress, language, deportment. Even their vices and
follies are fashionable, and most men are proud to imitate
and resemble them in the very qualities that dishonour and
degrade them. [Some people, Smith says, act as though they
had •the vices and follies of the rich and great, wanting to
be admired for this, even when they don’t approve of •them
and perhaps don’t even have •them. ‘There are hypocrites
of wealth and greatness, as well as of religion and virtue.’
He is sharply critical of the not-very-rich man who tries to
pass himself off as rich without thinking about the fact that
if he really adopts the way of life of a rich man he will soon

35

reduce himself ‘to beggary’. Then:]

To attain to this envied situation the candidates for
fortune too often abandon the path of virtue, which un-
fortunately sometimes goes in the exact opposite direction
from the path to wealth, status, fame. The ambitious man
comforts himself with the thought that in the splendid
situation that he is aiming at he’ll have so many ways to draw
the respect and admiration of mankind, and will be able to
act with such superior propriety and grace that the glow of
his future conduct will entirely cover or erase the foulness
of the steps by which he got there. In many governments
the candidates for the highest stations are above the law
[that clause is verbatim Smith]; and if they can attain the object
of their ambition they have no fear of being indicted for
anything they did to get there. So they often try to supplant
and destroy those who oppose or stand in the way of their
greatness—not only by fraud and falsehood (the ordinary
and vulgar arts of intrigue and plotting), but also sometimes
by committing the most enormous crimes, by murder and
assassination, by rebellion and civil war. They fail more
often than they succeed, and usually gain nothing but the
disgraceful punishment that their crimes deserve. And even
when they do attain that wished-for greatness, they ﬁnd
nothing like the happiness that they had expected to enjoy
in it. What the ambitious man is really after is not ease or
pleasure but always some kind of honour (though often an
honour that he doesn’t understand well); and the honour of
his exalted station seems to him and to other people to be
polluted and deﬁled by the baseness of his way of achieving it.
[Smith continues with a colourful account of the ambitious
man who reaches the top by disgusting means, tries every
trick to get •others and •himself to forget how he got there,
and fails in •both attempts. ’He is still secretly pursued by
the avenging furies of shame and remorse.’]

Smith on Moral Sentiments

Reward and punishment

Part II: Merit and demerit: the objects of reward and

punishment

Section 1: The sense of merit and demerit

Introduction

The actions and conduct of mankind can be brought within
range of approval/disapproval in two different ways: one is
through their being proper or improper, decent or graceless,
·right or wrong·; the other is through their having merit or
demerit, the qualities of deserving reward and of deserving
punishment.

I have already remarked that the sentiment or affection of
the heart [Smith’s phrase; see note on page 116 about ‘affection’] from
which an action comes, and on which its whole virtue or vice
depends, can be considered under two different aspects or
in two different relations:

(1) It can be considered in relation to the cause or object
that arouses it. The affection’s (un)suitableness or
(dis)proportion to the cause or object that arouses it
is what determines the (im)propriety, ·the rightness
or wrongness·, of the consequent action.

(2) It can be considered in relation to the end at which
it aims or the effect that it is likely to produce. The
affection’s tendency to produce beneﬁcial or harmful
effects is what determines the merit or demerit, the
good or ill desert, of the action to which it gives rise.

In Part I of this work I have explained what our sense of (1)
the propriety or impropriety of actions consists in. I now
start to consider what (2) the good or ill desert of actions
consists in.

Chapter 1: Whatever appears to be the proper object of
gratitude (resentment) appears to deserve reward (pun-
ishment)

[Smith’s ﬁrst paragraph repeats, at greater length but with
no more content, the proposition that is the chapter-title.
Then:]

The sentiment that most immediately and directly
prompts us to reward ·someone· is gratitude, and what most
immediately and directly prompts us to punish ·someone· is
resentment. So it’s bound to be the case that any action that
appears to be a proper and approved object of gratitude will
seem to us to deserve reward, and any action that appears
to be a proper and approved object of resentment will seem
to us to deserve punishment.

Rewarding is recompensing or repaying, returning good
for good received. Punishing is also recompensing or repay-
ing, though in a different manner; it is returning evil for evil
that has been done.

Gratitude and resentment are not the only passions that
interest us in the happiness or misery of other people; but
they are the ones that most directly arouse us to cause such
happiness or misery. If habitual approval of someone gives
us love and esteem for him, we are of course pleased that he
should have good fortune, and so we’re willing to lend a hand
to promote that. But our •love for him is fully satisﬁed if
his good fortune comes about without help from us. All this
passion wants is to see him happy, without regard for who is

36

Smith on Moral Sentiments

Gratitude and resentment

the author of his prosperity. But •gratitude can’t be satisﬁed
in this way. If someone to whom we owe many obligations is
made happy without our assistance, though this pleases our
love it doesn’t satisfy our gratitude. Until we have repaid
him, till we ourselves have been contributed to promoting
his happiness, we feel ourselves still loaded with the debt
that his past services have laid upon us.

Similarly, if habitual disapproval of someone makes us
hate and dislike him, that will often lead us to take a mali-
cious pleasure in his misfortune. But although •dislike and
hatred harden us against all sympathy, and sometimes even
dispose us to rejoice at the person’s distress, if no resentment
is involved—if neither we nor our friends have received
any great personal provocation—•these passions wouldn’t
naturally lead us to want to be instrumental in causing
such distress. Even if there was no risk of punishment for
having a hand in it, we would rather that his distress should
happen by some other means. To someone dominated by
violent hatred, it might be agreeable to hear that the person
he loathes and detests has been killed in an accident. But
if he has the least spark of justice (which he might have,
though violent hatred isn’t favourable to virtue), he would be
tremendously upset to have been the •unintentional cause
of the accident; and immeasurably more shocked by the
thought of having •voluntarily contributed to it. . . . But it’s
not like that with resentment.
If someone who has done
us some great injury—murdered our father or our brother,
for example—dies of a fever soon afterwards, or is executed
for some other crime, this might soothe our hatred but it
wouldn’t fully gratify our resentment. What our resentment
makes us want is not merely for

•him to be punished,

but also for

•him to be punished by us,

and for

•him to be punished for the particular injury that he
did to us.

Resentment can’t be fully satisﬁed unless the offender is not
only made to grieve in his turn, but to grieve for the particular
wrong we have suffered from him. He must be made to
repent and be sorry for that particular action. And the natural
gratiﬁcation of this passion tends automatically to produce
all the political ends of punishment—the correction of the
criminal, and the example to the public (who, through fear
of such punishment, will be scared off from being guilty
of a similar offence). So gratitude and resentment are the
sentiments that most immediately and directly prompt us to
reward and to punish; that is why anyone who seems to us
to be the proper and approved object of gratitude also seems
to us to deserve reward, and anyone who seems to us to be
the proper and approved object of resentment also seems to
us to deserve punishment..

Chapter 2: The proper objects of gratitude and resent-
ment

All it can mean to say that someone is ‘the proper and
approved object of gratitude (or resentment)’ is that he is
an object of gratitude (or resentment) that naturally seems
proper and is approved of. And what does it mean to say that
a given instance of gratitude or resentment ‘seems proper
and is approved of’? The same as it means to say this about
any other human passion, namely that the heart of every
impartial spectator entirely sympathizes with the passion in
question, i.e. that every unbiased bystander entirely enters
into the passion and goes along with it.

Therefore, a person appears to deserve reward if he is the
natural object of someone’s gratitude, this being an instance

37

Smith on Moral Sentiments

Gratitude and resentment

of gratitude that every human heart is disposed to beat
time to [Smith’s phrase], and thereby applaud. And a person
appears to deserve punishment if he is the natural object of
someone’s resentment, this being an instance of resentment
that the breast of every reasonable man is ready to adopt
and sympathize with. It is surely right to say that an action
appears to deserve reward if everyone who knows of it will
want it to be rewarded, and appears to deserve punishment
if everyone who hears of it is angry about it and for that
reason is happy to see it punished. ·I shall now put ﬂesh on
these two lots of bones·.

[The words ‘benefactor’ and ‘beneﬁciary’ will be used quite a lot in
this version, though Smith doesn’t use ‘benefactor’ so much and never
uses ‘beneﬁciary’. The aim is brevity—sparing us Smith’s ‘the person
who receives the beneﬁt’ and ‘the person who bestows the beneﬁt’.]

(1) Just as we sympathize with the joy of our companions
when they prosper, so also we join with them in their
contented and satisﬁed attitude to whatever is the cause
of their good fortune. We •enter into the love and affection
that they have for that cause, and •begin to love it too. We
would be sorry for their sakes if it were destroyed, or even
if it were placed too far away from them, out of the reach
of their care and protection, even if that distance wouldn’t
deprive them of anything except the pleasure of seeing it.
And this holds in a quite special way if the cause of our
brethren’s happiness is another person. When we see one
man being assisted, protected, and relieved by another, our
sympathy with the joy of the beneﬁciary serves to enliven our
fellow-feeling with his gratitude towards his benefactor. We
look on the benefactor in the way we imagine the beneﬁciary
must look on him; the benefactor seems to stand before
us in the most attractive and amiable light. So we ﬁnd it
easy to sympathize with the beneﬁciary’s grateful affection
for the person to whom he has been so much obliged; and

that leads us to applaud the good things that he is disposed
to do in return for the good that has been done for him.
As we entirely enter into the affection that produces these
return-beneﬁts, they necessarily seem to be in every way
proper and suitable to their object.

(2) In the same way that we sympathize with the sorrow
of our fellow-creature when we see his distress, we enter into
his abhorrence and aversion towards whatever has caused
it. As our heart adopts •his grief and beats time to it, so
it is ﬁlled with the spirit by which he tries to drive away or
destroy the cause of •it. The slack and passive fellow-feeling
with which we accompany him in •his sufferings gives way
to the more vigorous and active sentiment with which we go
along with him in his effort either to repel •them or to gratify
his aversion to whatever it was that caused •them. This
is especially the case when the cause of his sufferings is a
human person. When we see one man oppressed or injured
by another, our sympathy with the distress of the sufferer
animates our fellow-feeling with his resentment against the
offender. We rejoice to see him hit back at his adversary, and
are eager and ready to help him whenever he exerts himself
•in self-defence or even (within limits) •in getting revenge.
If the sufferer dies in the quarrel, we sympathize not only
with the real resentment of his friends and relatives but
also with the resentment that we imagine to be felt by the
dead man, who in fact can no longer feel that or any other
human sentiment. . . . The sympathetic tears that we shed
for the immense and irretrievable loss that we imagine him
to have sustained seems like only a small part of the duty
we owe him. The injury he has suffered demands, we think,
a principal part of our attention. We feel the resentment
that we imagine he. . . .would feel if his cold and lifeless body
retained any awareness of what happens on earth. His blood,
we think, calls aloud for vengeance. . . . The horrors that

38

Smith on Moral Sentiments

Analysing the sense of merit and demerit

are supposed to haunt the bed of the murderer, the ghosts
that (superstition imagines) rise from their graves to demand
vengeance on those who cut their lives short, all arise from
this natural sympathy with the imaginary resentment of the
murdered person. At least with this most dreadful of all
crimes, nature has in this way stamped on the human heart,
in the strongest and most indelible characters, an immediate
and instinctive approval of the sacred and necessary law of
retaliation, this being something that comes into play before
any thoughts about the utility of punishment.

Chapter 3: Where there’s no approval of the bene-
factor’s conduct, there’s not much sympathy with
the beneﬁciary’s gratitude; and where there’s no
disapproval of the motives of the person who does
someone harm, there’s absolutely no sympathy
with the victim’s resentment

[The ﬁrst paragraph of this chapter repeats, without signiﬁ-
cant additions, what is said in the chapter’s heading. Then:]
(1) When we can’t sympathize with the affections of the
benefactor, when there seems to be no propriety in his
reasons for acting as he did, we’re less disposed to enter
into the gratitude of the beneﬁciary. A very small return
seems enough to reward the foolish and profuse generosity
that confers great beneﬁts for trivial reasons—e.g. giving a
man an estate merely because he has the same personal
name and family name as the giver. . . . In a case like that,
our contempt for the folly of the benefactor hinders us from
thoroughly entering into the gratitude of the beneﬁciary; the
benefactor seems unworthy of it. . . . Monarchs who have
heaped wealth, power, and honours onto their favourites
haven’t often aroused the degree of attachment to their
persons that has often been experienced by those who were

less lavish in handing out favours. The good-natured but
unwise lavishness of James I of Great Britain doesn’t seem
to have brought him anyone’s personal loyalty; despite his
social and harmless disposition, he appears to have lived and
died without a friend. Whereas the whole gentry and nobility
of England risked their lives and fortunes in the cause of his
more frugal and discriminating son, ·Charles I·, despite the
coldness and distant severity of his ordinary behaviour.

(2) When one person suffers at the hands of another, and
the agent’s conduct appears to have been entirely directed
by motives and affections that we thoroughly enter into
and approve of, we can’t have any sort of sympathy with
the sufferer’s resentment, no matter how great the harm
that has been done to him. When two people quarrel, if we
sympathize with and entirely adopt the resentment of one of
them, we can’t possibly enter into the other’s. Our sympathy
with the person whose motives we go along with, and whom
we therefore look on as in the right, is bound to harden us
against all fellow-feeling with the other ·party to the quarrel·,
whom we necessarily regard as being in the wrong. Whatever
he has suffered, while it is no more than what we ourselves
would have wanted him to suffer, no more than what our
own sympathetic indignation would have prompted us to
inﬂict on him, it can’t either displease or provoke us. When
an inhuman murderer is brought to the scaffold, though
we have some compassion for his misery we can’t have any
sort of fellow-feeling with any resentment that he is absurd
enough to express any against his prosecutor or his judge.
The natural outcome of their just indignation is indeed most
fatal and ruinous to him; but we can’t be displeased with
the consequences of a sentiment that we feel that we cannot
avoid adopting when we bring the case home to ourselves.

Analysing the sense of merit and demerit

Chapter 4: Recapitulation of the preceding chap-
ters

[This short chapter is what its title says it is, and no more.]

Chapter 5: Analysing the sense of merit and demerit

(1) So it comes down to this: When one person x acts upon
another person y (if I may put it like that; ·I mean when x
acts in some way that has consequences affecting y·), our
sense of the propriety of x’s conduct arises from what I’ll
call a •direct sympathy with x’s affections and motives; and
our sense of the merit of x’s conduct arises from what I’ll
call an •indirect sympathy with y’s gratitude. [Strictly speaking,
there is nothing indirect about the latter sympathy; what is indirect is
that sympathy’s relationship to x.]

On this account,. . . .the sense of merit seems to be a
compound sentiment, made up of two distinct emotions—a
direct sympathy with the sentiments of the benefactor and
an indirect sympathy with the gratitude of his beneﬁciaries.
[Smith now offers a fairly long paragraph applying this
account to our emotions as we read works of history. This
doesn’t add anything to the account, except for the remark
that ‘we are shocked beyond all measure if beneﬁciaries
seem by their conduct to have little sense of the obligations
conferred on them’.]

(2) In the same way that our sense of the impropriety of
the conduct of a person x arises from our lack of sympathy for
(or even an outright antipathy to) x’s affections and motives,
so also our sense of its demerit arises from what I’ll again
call an indirect sympathy with the person y who has suffered
from x’s conduct.

of merit in being a compounded sentiment, made up of two
distinct emotions; a direct antipathy to x’s sentiments and
an indirect sympathy with y’s resentment.

[Again Smith applies this to the varying emotional states
of a reader of history. This colourful account reaches a
climax here:] Our sense of the horror and dreadful atrocity
of such conduct, the delight we get from hearing that it was
properly punished, the indignation we feel when it escapes
this due retaliation, in short our whole sense and feeling of
what that conduct deserves—of the propriety and ﬁtness of
inﬂicting evil on the person who is guilty of it and making
him grieve in his turn—arises from the sympathetic indig-
nation that naturally boils up in the breast of the spectator
whenever he thoroughly brings home to himself the situation
of the sufferer.

[The rest of this chapter was originally a long footnote.]
I have attributed our natural •sense of the ill desert of
human actions to our sympathy with the resentment of the
sufferer; and many people—perhaps most—will see this as
a degradation of •that sentiment. Resentment is commonly
regarded as so odious they they’ll tend to think it impossible
that something as praiseworthy as the sense of the ill desert
of vice should be in any way based on it. They may be
more willing to admit that our sense of the merit of good
actions is based on our sympathy with the gratitude of the
beneﬁciaries, because gratitude—along with all the other
benevolent passions—is regarded as a likeable motive that
can’t detract from the value of whatever is based on it. ·But
that immediately puts them in a difﬁculty, because· gratitude
and resentment are obviously in every respect counterparts
to one another; if our sense of merit arises from a sympathy
with the one, our sense of demerit can hardly not come from
a fellow-feeling with the other.

So it seems that the sense of demerit is like the sense

And here is another point. Resentment at the level at

40

Smith on Moral Sentiments

Analysing the sense of merit and demerit

which we too often see it is indeed just about the most odious
of all the passions, but it isn’t disapproved of when it doesn’t
ﬂy so high and is brought right down to the level of the spec-
tator’s sympathetic indignation. When we bystanders feel
that the sufferer’s resentment doesn’t in any way go beyond
our own, when no word or gesture escapes him that indicates
an emotion more violent than what we can keep time to, and
when he never aims at inﬂicting any punishment beyond
what we would rejoice to see inﬂicted. . . ., it is impossible
that we won’t entirely approve of his sentiments. Our own
emotion in this case is bound to strike us as clearly justifying
his. And as we learn from experience how incapable most
people are of this moderation, and how great an effort it
would take them to bring the rough undisciplined impulse of
resentment down to this suitable level, we can’t help having
a considerable degree of esteem and admiration for anyone
who manages to do so. When the sufferer’s animosity exceeds
(as it nearly always does) anything that we can go along with,
we can’t enter into it and so, inevitably, we disapprove of it.
[Smith says that our disapproval of excessive resentment is
greater than our disapproval of any other excess of passion,
amounts of excess being equal. Then:] That is why revenge,
the excess of resentment, appears to be the most detestable
of all the passions and is an object of everyone’s horror and
indignation. And because excessive instances of this passion
outnumber moderate ones a hundred to one, we’re much
inclined to regard it as odious and detestable right across
the board.
(Depraved as we are, Nature hasn’t built into
us any drive or motive that is wholly evil in every way, i.e.
that can’t be properly praised and approved of whatever its
intensity level and direction of aim.) On some occasions we
have a sense that this usually-too-strong passion is too weak.
[Smith elaborates that along the lines of page 21 above.]

The writers ·in the Old Testament· wouldn’t have talked

so often or so strongly of God’s wrath and anger if they had
regarded every degree of those passions as vicious and evil,
even in so weak and imperfect a creature as man.

Please bear in mind that this inquiry is about a matter not
of •right but of •fact. We’re concerned here with principles ·or
criteria· to guide approval of the punishment of bad actions;
the topic isn’t the principles on the basis of which a perfect
being would arrive at such approvals but rather the ones
by which weak and imperfect men actually do arrive at
them. It’s obvious that the principles I have mentioned have
a great effect on a man’s sentiments; and it seems wisely
ordered that they should do so. The very existence of society
requires that undeserved and unprovoked malice should be
restrained by proper punishments, and thus that inﬂicting
those punishments should be regarded as a proper and
laudable action. And men are naturally endowed with a
desire for •the welfare and preservation of society; but the
Author of nature hasn’t left it to men to use their reason
to work out what kinds and levels of punishment are right
for •this purpose; rather, he has endowed men with an
immediate and instinctive approval of just precisely the kind
and level of punishment that is most proper to attain •it.
The arrangement that nature has made here is like what
it has done in many other contexts. With regard to all the
specially important purposes—the ones that we might call
nature’s favourites—she has endowed mankind not only with
an appetite for the end that she proposes, but also with an
appetite for the only means by which this end can be brought
about. (I mean: an appetite for them for their own sakes,
independently of any thought about what they might lead to.)
Thus self-preservation and the propagation of the species
seem to be the great ends that Nature has proposed in the
formation of all animals; and men are endowed with a desire
for those ends, and an aversion to the contrary. . . . But it

41

Smith on Moral Sentiments

Comparing those two virtues

hasn’t been left to the slow and uncertain conclusions of our
reason to discover how to bring those ends about. Nature
has directed us to most of them by basic immediate instincts:

hunger,
thirst,
sexual passion,
the love of pleasure,
the fear of pain.

We seek all these for their own sakes, and not because they
are conducive to survival and the propagation of our species;
but they are conducive to them, and they are what the great
Director of nature intended as a means to them.

[The enormous footnote concludes with an extremely
difﬁcult, confusing, and probably confused paragraph about
a certain ‘difference between the approval of propriety and
the approval of merit’.]

Section 2: Justice and beneﬁcence

Chapter I: Comparing those two virtues

The only actions that seem to require reward are ones that
•tend to do good and •come from proper motives, because
they’re the only ones that are approved objects of gratitude,
i.e. that arouse the sympathetic gratitude of the spectator.

The only actions that seem to seem to deserve pun-
ishment are ones that •tend to do harm and •come from
improper motives, because they’re the only ones that are
approved objects of resentment, i.e. arouse the sympathetic
resentment of the spectator.

Beneﬁcence is always free, it can’t be extorted by force,
and merely not giving doesn’t expose one to punishment,
because the mere lack of beneﬁcence doesn’t tend to produce
real positive evil. It may disappoint someone who had rea-
sonably expected some beneﬁt, and on that account it may
justly arouse dislike and disapproval; but it can’t provoke
any resentment that mankind will go along with. The man
who doesn’t recompense his benefactor when he has it in his
power to do so, and when his benefactor needs his help, is no

doubt guilty of black ingratitude. No impartial spectator will
have any fellow-feeling with the selﬁshness of his motives,
and he is the proper object of the highest disapproval. But
still he does no positive harm to anyone. [Smith presumably
means ‘he doesn’t positively do harm’.] He merely doesn’t do the
good that in propriety he ought to have done. He is an object
of •hatred, a passion naturally aroused by impropriety of
sentiment and behaviour. but not of •resentment, a passion
that is properly aroused only by actions that tend to do real
positive harm to some particular persons. So this person’s
lack of gratitude can’t be punished. To oblige him by force
to do what gratitude should lead him to do, and what every
impartial spectator would approve of him for doing, would
be even more improper than his neglecting to do it. His
benefactor would dishonour himself if he tried by violence to
force him into gratitude, and it would be mere meddling for
any third person to intervene unless he was the superior of
one of the other two [‘superior’ here means ‘employer or commanding
ofﬁcer or. . . ’]. But of all the duties of beneﬁcence, those that

42

Smith on Moral Sentiments

Comparing those two virtues

are recommended by gratitude come closest to what is called
a perfect and complete obligation—·i.e. come closest to the
status of ‘You deserve to be punished if you don’t’·. What we
are prompted to do by friendship, by generosity, by charity,
meeting with universal approval when we do so, is even more
free than the duties of gratitude, even further from being
extortable by force. We have the phrase ‘a debt of gratitude’;
we do not speak of ‘a debt of charity’ or ‘. . . of generosity’ or
even ‘. . . of friendship’ except when the friendship relation
has bases for gratitude mixed in with it.

It seems that nature gave us resentment for our own
defence and only for that. It is the safeguard of justice and
the security of innocence. It prompts us to beat off harm
that others are trying to do to us, and to retaliate for harm
already done, so that •the offender may be caused to be sorry
for what he did, and so that •others, through fear of similar
punishment, may be frightened off from similar offences.
So resentment must be reserved for these purposes; the
spectator will never go along with it when it is exerted for any
other purpose. And the mere lack of the beneﬁcent virtues
doesn’t (and doesn’t try to) do any harm from which we can
have occasion to defend ourselves.

But there’s another virtue the observance of •which is not
left to the freedom of our own wills, •which may be extorted
by force, and •the violation of which exposes the agent to
resentment and thus to punishment. This virtue is justice;
the violation of justice is injury; it does real positive harm
to some particular persons, from motives that are naturally
disapproved of. So it is a proper object of resentment, and of
the natural consequence of resentment, namely punishment.
Mankind go along with and approve of the violence employed
to avenge the harm that is done by injustice, and to an
even greater extent they go along with and approve of the
violence that is used •to prevent and beat off the injury

and •to restrain the offender from harming his neighbours.
Someone who is thinking of committing an injustice is aware
of this, and feels that force may properly be used, both
by his intended victim and by others, either to stop him
from committing his crime or to punish him when he has
committed it. This is the basis for the remarkable distinction
between •justice and •all the other social virtues that was
recently emphasized by an author of great and original
genius, namely:

We feel ourselves to be under a stricter obligation to
act according to •justice than to act in ways that ﬁt
with •friendship, •charity, or •generosity. Whether
we perform these last three virtues seems to be left
somewhat to our own choice; but we feel somehow
that we are in a special way tied, bound, and obliged
to conform to justice ·in our conduct·. We feel that
force may, with the utmost propriety and with the
approval of all mankind, be used to make us conform
to justice, but not to follow the precepts of the other
social virtues.

But we must always carefully distinguish •what is only
blamable or a proper object of disapproval from •what
may be either punished or prevented by force. Something
seems blamable if it falls short of the ordinary degree of
proper beneﬁcence that experience teaches us to expect of
everybody; and something seems praiseworthy if it goes
beyond that degree of beneﬁcence. Conduct that is at the
ordinary degree of beneﬁcence seems neither blameworthy
nor praiseworthy. Someone who behaves towards his son,
his father, his brother, in a manner that is neither better
nor worse than the conduct of most men, seems properly to
deserve neither praise nor blame. . . .

But even the most ordinary degree of kindness or benef-
icence can’t, among equals, be extorted by force. Among

43

Smith on Moral Sentiments

Comparing those two virtues

equals each individual is—•naturally, and •independently
of the institution of civil government—regarded as having a
right to defend himself from injuries and to exact a certain
degree of punishment for injuries that have been done to him.
Every generous spectator not only •approves of his conduct
when he does this, but •enters so far into his sentiments
that he is often willing to help him in this. . . . But when

•a father falls short of the ordinary degree of parental
affection towards a son, or
•a son’s attitude to his father seems to lack the ﬁlial
reverence that might be expected, or
•brothers are without the usual degree of brotherly
affection, or
•a man shuts out compassion and refuses to relieve
the misery of his fellow-creatures though he could
easily do so

—in all these cases, though everyone blames the conduct,
no-one imagines that those who might have reason to expect
more kindness have any right to extort it by force. The
sufferer can only complain, and the spectator can’t interfere
except advising and persuading. In all such cases it would
be thought the highest degree of insolence and presumption
for equals to use force against one another.

A superior may sometimes require people under his
jurisdiction to behave, in this respect, with a certain degree of
propriety towards one another; and no-one will ﬁnd fault with
his doing this. The laws of all civilized nations •oblige parents
to support their children, and ·adult· children to support
their ·aged· parents, and •impose on men many other duties
of beneﬁcence. [The phrase ‘the civil magistrate’, which we are about
to meet, referred to any ofﬁcial whose job is to apply and enforce the
laws; but Smith and some other writers extended it to cover also anyone
who makes the civil laws.] The civil magistrate is entrusted
with the power not only of •preserving the public peace by

restraining injustice, but also of •promoting the prosperity
of the commonwealth by establishing good discipline and
discouraging every sort of vice and impropriety. So it is
all right for him to prescribe rules that don’t just prohibit
citizens from harming one another but also command that
they help one another to a certain degree. If the sovereign
commands the citizens to do A, from then on not-doing-A is
disobedience and is not only blameworthy but punishable.
That holds even if before the sovereign’s command there had
been no blame attached to not-doing-A, and it holds more
strongly still if not-doing-A had been highly blameworthy
even before the sovereign commanded the doing of A. Of
all the duties of a law-giver, however, this may be the one
that needs the greatest delicacy and caution to perform with
propriety and judgment. To neglect it altogether exposes
the commonwealth to many gross disorders and shocking
crimes, and to push it too far is destructive of all liberty,
security, and justice.

Though the lack of beneﬁcence doesn’t seem to deserve
punishment among equals, the greater efforts of that virtue
do appear to deserve the highest reward. By producing the
greatest good they become natural and approved objects of
the liveliest gratitude. On the other hand, a man’s •breach of
justice exposes him to punishment, whereas his •observing
the rules of that virtue hardly seem to deserve any reward.
There is certainly a propriety in behaving justly, so that such
conduct deserves all the approval that is due to propriety.
But because it does no real positive good it isn’t entitled to
much gratitude. If the best we can say of someone is that he
doesn’t violate the persons or estates or reputations of his
neighbours, he surely doesn’t have much positive merit. But
he does fulﬁll all the rules of justice, strictly so-called, and
does everything that his equals can properly •force him to
do or •punish him for not doing. We can often fulﬁll all the

44

Smith on Moral Sentiments

Remorse and its opposite

rules of justice by sitting still and doing nothing!

As you treat others, so they will treat you; and retaliation
seems to be the great law that Nature dictates to us. We
think of beneﬁcence and generosity as being owed to those
who are themselves generous and beneﬁcent. As for those
who never open up their hearts to the feelings of humanity,
we think that they should be correspondingly •shut out from
the affections of all their fellow-creatures and •allowed to
live in the midst of society as though in a great desert where
there’s nobody to care for them. . . . Someone who violates
the laws of justice ought to be made to feel for himself the
evil that he has done to someone else; and because he can’t
be •restrained by his brethren’s sufferings, he ought to be
•over-awed by the fear of his own! The man who is merely
innocent—observing the laws of justice with regard to others,
abstaining from harming his neighbours, but doing no more
than that—can deserve only that his neighbours should
respect his innocence in return, and that the same laws
should be scrupulously observed with regard to him.

Chapter 2: The sense of justice, of remorse, and of the
consciousness of merit

The only proper motive for harming our neighbour—the only
incitement to do evil to someone else that mankind will go
along with—is just indignation for evil that the other person
has done to us. To disturb his happiness merely because it
stands in the way of our own, to take from him what is of
real use to him merely because it may be of equal or of more
use to us, or in this way to act on the natural preference that
every man has for his own happiness above that of other
people, is something that no impartial spectator can go along
with. There’s no doubt that nature gives to each man the
primary responsibility for his own care; and it’s ﬁt and right

that this should be so, because each man is better able to
take care of himself than anyone else is.
It follows from
this that each man is much more deeply concerned •with
whatever is immediately connected with himself than •with
what has to do with anyone else. Hearing about the death
of someone with whom we have no particular connection
will probably give us less concern—will do less in the way of
putting us off our food or disturbing our sleep—than would
a very insigniﬁcant disaster that has befallen ourselves. But
although the ruin of our neighbour may affect us much
less than a small misfortune of our own, we mustn’t ruin
him in order to prevent that small misfortune—or even to
prevent our own ruin.
In all cases like this we must see
ourselves not in the light in which we naturally appear to
•ourselves but rather in the light in which we naturally
appear to •others. . . . Though each man’s happiness may
matter to him more than the happiness of the rest of the
world, to every other person it doesn’t matter any more
than anyone else’s. So although it may be true that every
individual, in his own breast, naturally prefers himself to
all mankind, he won’t dare to look mankind in the face and
declare that he acts according to this principle. He feels that
they can never go along with him in this preference, and
that however natural it may be to him it must always appear
excessive and extravagant to them. When he views himself
in the light in which he’s aware that others will view him, he
sees that to them he’s merely one of the multitude and in
no way better than any of the others. If he wants to act in
such a way that an impartial spectator can may enter into
the motives of his conduct—that being what he wants most
of all—he must now and always humble the arrogance of his
self-love, bringing it down to something that other men can
go along with. They will accept his self-love far enough to
allow him to care about his own happiness more than anyone

45

Smith on Moral Sentiments

Remorse and its opposite

else’s—to care about it more and to work more intently on its
behalf. When they place themselves in his situation, they’ll
readily go along with him to that extent.
In the race for
wealth, honours, and promotions he may run as hard as he
can, straining every nerve and muscle in order to outstrip all
his competitors. But if he should jostle or trip any of them,
the allowance of the spectators is entirely at an end—that
is a violation of fair play that they can’t allow. . . . They now
sympathize with the natural resentment of the person who
was shouldered aside or tripped, and the offender becomes
an object of their hatred and indignation. He is aware of this,
and feels that those sentiments are ready to burst out from
all sides against him.

The greater and more irreparable the evil that is done,

the greater is

•the resentment of the sufferer,
•the sympathetic indignation of the spectator, and
•the sense of guilt in the agent.

Death is the greatest evil that one man can inﬂict on an-
other, and it arouses the highest degree of resentment in
those who are immediately connected with the person who
has been killed. Thus, of all the crimes that affect only
individuals murder is the most atrocious—in the sight of
mankind, and in the sight of the murderer. Being •deprived
of something that we now possess is a greater evil than being
•disappointed in some expectation of receiving a certain good.
That is why theft and robbery (which take our possessions)
are greater crimes than breach of contract (which merely
disappoints our expectations). So the most sacred laws of
justice—the ones the violation of which seems to call loudest
for vengeance and punishment—are the laws that guard our
neighbour’s •life and person; next in line come those that
guard his •property and possessions; and lastly those that
guard what are called his •personal rights, or what is due to

him from the promises of others.

If someone who violates the more sacred laws of justice
ever thinks about the sentiments that mankind must have
regarding him, he has to feel all the agonies of shame, horror,
and consternation. When his passion—·i.e. the passion that
caused him to act so badly in the ﬁrst place·—is gratiﬁed,
and he starts to think coolly about his past conduct, he
can’t enter into ·or sympathize with· any of the motives that
inﬂuenced it. They now appear as detestable to him as they
always did to other people. By sympathizing with the hatred
and abhorrence that other men must have towards him, he
now to some extent hates and abhors himself. The situation
of the person who has suffered from his injustice now draws
pity from him. He is grieved at the thought of it, and regrets
•the unhappy effects of his conduct, feeling that •they have
made him the proper object of mankind’s resentment and in-
dignation of mankind, and of the vengeance and punishment
that naturally ﬂow from such resentment. . . . His fellow-
creatures’ memory of his crimes shuts out from their hearts
all fellow-feeling with him; the sentiments that they do have
regarding him are just what he is most afraid of. Everything
seems hostile; he would like to escape to some inhospitable
desert where he would never have to confront any human
creature, never have to read in mankind’s countenance the
condemnation of his crimes. But solitude is even more
dreadful than society. His own thoughts can present him
with nothing but what is black, unfortunate, and disastrous,
the miserable expectation of incomprehensible misery and
ruin. The horror of solitude drives him back into society,
and he returns—bewildered, ashamed, and terriﬁed—into
the presence of mankind, in order to beg for some little
protection from the those very judges who he knows have
already unanimously condemned him! Such is the nature of
the sentiment of remorse, properly so-called; it is the most

46

Smith on Moral Sentiments

Utility of this constitution

dreadful sentiment that human beings are capable of. It is
compounded out of •shame from the sense of the impropriety
of past conduct; •grief for the effects of it; •pity for those who
have suffered through it; and, because of the justly provoked
resentment of all rational creatures, •the dread and terror of
punishment.

The opposite behaviour naturally inspires the opposite
sentiment. Take the case of a man who has performed a
generous action, not as a frivolous whim but from proper
motives. When he looks forward to those whom he has
served, he feels himself to be the natural object of their love
and gratitude and, by sympathy with them, of the esteem
and approval of all mankind. And when he looks back to
•the motive from which he acted, viewing it in the light in
which the unbiased spectator will survey it, he still enters
into •it and, by sympathy with the approval of this supposed
impartial judge, he applauds himself. In both these points of
view, ·forward and backward·, his own conduct appears
to him every way agreeable. The thought of it ﬁlls his
mind with cheerfulness, serenity, and composure. He is in
friendship and harmony with all mankind, and looks on his
fellow-creatures with conﬁdence and benevolent satisfaction,
knowing that he has made himself worthy of their most
favourable regards. The combination of all these sentiments
constitute the consciousness of merit, i.e. the consciousness
of deserving to be rewarded.

Chapter 3: The utility of this constitution of nature

That is how man, who can’t survive except in society, was
equipped by nature for the situation for which he was made.
Each member of the human society needs help from the
others, and is vulnerable to harm from them. When the
needed help is given and returned from love, gratitude,

friendship, and esteem, the society ﬂourishes and is happy.
Its different members are all bound together by the agreeable
bands of love and affection. . . .

But even if the needed help is not given from such
generous and disinterested motives, even if the different
members of the society don’t have love and affection for one
another, the society won’t necessarily fall apart, though it will
be less happy and agreeable. Society can stay alive among
different men, as it can among different merchants, from
a sense of its utility, without any mutual love or affection.
Even if no-one has any obligations or debts of gratitude to
anyone else, society can still be held together by a trade
[Smith says ‘mercenary exchange’] in beneﬁts, on the basis of
agreed valuation for each beneﬁt.

What society can’t do is to survive among those who are
constantly ready to harm and injure one another. The mo-
ment that injury begins, the moment that mutual resentment
and hostility kick in, all society’s bands are snapped and its
different members are (so to speak) dissipated and scattered
around by the violence and opposition of their discordant
affections [see page 116 note on ‘affection’]. (If there is any society
among robbers and murderers, they must at least. . . .abstain
from robbing and murdering one another.) So beneﬁcence
is less essential than justice is to the existence of society; a
lack of beneﬁcence will make a society uncomfortable, but
the prevalence of injustice will utterly destroy it.

That is why Nature, while urging mankind to acts of
beneﬁcence by the pleasing awareness of deserved reward,
hasn’t thought it necessary to guard and enforce beneﬁcent
conduct by the terrors of deserved punishment in case it
should be neglected. Beneﬁcence is an ornament that makes
the building more beautiful, not the foundation that holds
it up; so it’s good that it should be •recommended, but it
doesn’t have to be •imposed. In contrast with that, justice

47

Smith on Moral Sentiments

Utility of this constitution

is the main pillar that holds up the entire building. If it is
removed, the whole of human society—

the great, the immense structure whose creation and
support seems to have been Nature’s special care, her
cherished project

—must in a moment crumble into atoms. In order to enforce
the maintenance of justice, therefore, Nature has implanted
in mankind the awareness of guilt, the terrors of deserved
punishment that come with its violation, as the great safe-
guards of human society, to protect the weak, curb the
violent, and punish the guilty. Although men are naturally
sympathetic,

•they feel so little for anyone with whom they have no
special connection, compared with what they feel for
themselves,
•the misery of someone who is merely their fellow-
creature matters so little to them in comparison with
even a small convenience of their own, and
•they have it so much in their power to harm their
fellow-creature and may have so many temptations to
do so,

that if this fear-of-punishment mechanism didn’t go to work
within them in the fellow-creature’s defence, aweing them
into a respect for his innocence, they would like wild beasts
be ready at all times to attack him, and a man would enter
an assembly of men as he enters a den of lions.

All through the universe we see means delicately adjusted
to the ends they are intended to produce. In the mechanism
of a plant or animal body we admire how everything is con-
trived for advancing the two great purposes of nature—•the
support of the individual and •the propagation of the species.
But in everything like this we still distinguish the cause of the
various motions and structures from their purpose. [Smith
calls this distinguishing their ‘efﬁcient cause’ from their ‘ﬁnal cause’.]

The digestion of the food, the circulation of the blood,. . . .and
so on are all operations that are necessary for the great
purposes of animal life. But we don’t try to explain them
in terms of those purposes in the way one might explain
them in terms of their efﬁcient causes. We don’t imagine
that the blood circulates or the food digests of its own accord,
intending to achieve the purposes of circulation or digestion.
The wheels of a watch are admirably adjusted to the purpose
for which it was made, telling the time. All their various
motions work together in the most precise way to produce
If they wanted and intended to tell the time,
this effect.
they couldn’t do it better! But we attribute that desire and
intention not to the wheels but to the watch-maker, and
we know that what makes them move is a spring, which
doesn’t intend to produce its effect any more than they
do. ·This is standard stuff·: When we are explaining the
operations of bodies, we always in this way distinguish
the cause from the purpose [‘the efﬁcient from the ﬁnal cause’].
Yet when we are explaining the operations of minds, we
are apt to run these two different things together. When
natural forces lead us to pursue purposes that a reﬁned
and enlightened reason would recommend to us, we’re apt
to think of that enlightened reason as though it were the
efﬁcient cause of the sentiments and actions by which we
pursue our purpose. . . . On a superﬁcial view, this cause
seems sufﬁcient to produce the effects that we credit it with,
and the system of human nature seems to be simpler and
more agreeable when all its different operations are in this
way explained in terms of a single cause, ·namely reason·.
As society •cannot survive unless the laws of justice are
mainly observed, and as social interactions •cannot take
place among men who don’t generally abstain from injuring
one another; it has been thought that our awareness of this
•necessity is what led us to approve of the enforcement of

48

Smith on Moral Sentiments

Utility of this constitution

the laws of justice by the punishment of those who violated
them. Here in more detail is how this line of thought goes:
Man has a natural love for society, and wants the
union of mankind to be preserved for its own sake,
independently of whether he himself would get any
beneﬁt from it. The orderly and ﬂourishing state of
society is agreeable to him, and he loves the thought
of it. He dislikes social disorder and confusion, and is
upset by anything that tends to produce it. He does
also realize that his own welfare is connected with
the prosperity of society, and that its preservation is
needed for his happiness and perhaps for his survival.
So he has every reason to hate anything that can
tend to destroy society, and is willing to use every
possible means to hinder such a hated and dreadful
event. Injustice necessarily tends to destroy society.
So every appearance of injustice alarms him, and he
rushes to stop the progress of anything that would
quickly put an end to all that is dear to him if it were
allowed to continue unchecked. If he can’t restrain
it by gentle and fair means he must beat it down by
force and violence—he must somehow put a stop to
its further progress. That is why he often approves
of the enforcement of the laws of justice through the
punishment of those who violate them—even their
capital punishment, which removes the disturber of
the public peace from the world, and terriﬁes others
by the example it sets.

That’s what people commonly say about our approval of the
punishment of injustice. And there is truth in it: we often
have occasion to conﬁrm our natural sense of the propriety
and ﬁtness of punishment by thinking about how necessary
it is for preserving the order of society. When

mankind’s natural indignation declares to be due to
his crimes, and
•the insolence of his injustice is broken and humbled
by his terror of the approaching punishment, and
•he is no longer someone to be feared, and for generous
and humane people begins to be someone to be pitied,
the thought of what he is about to suffer extinguishes
people’s resentment towards him—resentment arising from
the sufferings of his victims. They are disposed to pardon and
forgive him, and to save him from the punishment that they
had in their cool hours regarded as the proper retribution
for such crimes. So here they look for help to considerations
of the general interests of society. They counterbalance
the impulse of this weak and partial humaneness by the
dictates of a humanity that is more comprehensive. They
reﬂect that mercy to the guilty is cruelty to the innocent, and
they counter the emotions of compassion that they feel for a
particular person by a broader compassion that they feel for
mankind.

Sometimes too we ﬁnd it appropriate to use the ‘It’s
necessary for the support of society’ defence ·not merely
of punishment for injustice but also· of the propriety of
observing the general rules of justice in the ﬁrst place.
We often hear the young and the restless ridiculing the
most sacred rules of morality, and proclaiming the most
abominable maxims of conduct—sometimes because they
have become morally rotten but more often because of the
emptiness of their hearts. Our indignation rises, and we are
eager to refute and expose such detestable principles. Now,
what initially inﬂames us against these principles is their
intrinsic detestableness. [Smith then presents in a rather
tangled form two lines of thought involving the claims that
the principles in question

•the guilty man is about to suffer the retaliation that

(a) are natural and proper objects of hatred and

49

Utility of this constitution

detestation,

(b) are ones that we hate and detest,
(c) ought to be condemned.

Defending (c) purely on the basis of (b) wouldn’t appear to
be conclusive (Smith says we think). It might be better to
base (c) on (b) if that were based on (a). But the fact is
that when we are confronted by people who reject the basic
principles of justice, it’s not going to do any good to talk
about actual or legitimate hatred and detestation because,
Smith continues:] when we are asked ‘Why shouldn’t we do
A?’ the very question seems to show that doing A doesn’t
appear to the questioner to be ·in itself· a natural and proper
object of hatred. So we must show him that A ought to be
done for the sake of something else. And that is what starts
us looking around for other arguments, and then what we
come up with ﬁrst is the disorder and confusion of society
that would result from everyone’s behaving unjustly. We
seldom fail, therefore, to insist on this topic.

But although it’s usually obvious that the welfare of
society is put at risk by •licentious practices, that thought is
seldom what ﬁrst arouses us against •them. All men, even
the most stupid and unthinking ones, loathe fraud, perﬁdy,
and injustice, and are delighted to see them punished. But
although it is obvious that justice is necessary for the
existence of society, that’s something that few men have
ever thought about.

·I am contending that· what basically puts us in favour
of the punishment of crimes against individuals is not our
concern for the preservation of society. There are many
obvious reasons for this.
(1) Our concern for the fortune
and happiness of •individuals doesn’t ordinarily arise from
our concern for the fortune and happiness of •society. This
thought—

‘I am concerned for the destruction of that man,

because he is a member or part of society,’

when said by someone who really cares about society as a
whole, is as silly as this—

‘I am concerned for the loss of a single guinea, because
it is a part of a thousand guineas’

when said by someone who really cares about a thousand
guineas. In neither case does our concern for the individuals
arise from our concern for the multitude; in each case our
concern for the multitude is composed out of the particu-
lar concerns that we feel for the different individuals that
make it up. When someone steals money from me, what
motivates my prosecution of him is not a concern for the
preservation of my whole fortune, but rather my concern for
the particular sum that was stolen; and, similarly, when one
man is harmed or destroyed, what motivates our demand
that the perpetrator be punished is not our concern for
the general interest of society, but rather our concern for
that one individual person who has been harmed. [Smith
goes on to distinguish this concern-for-the-individual from
the delicately detailed concern that we might have for an
individual friend, lover, mentor or the like. All we have here
is a concern for someone because he is our fellow-creature.
How we feel about him personally doesn’t come into it; or
anyway it shouldn’t, though Smith admits that it is likely to
do so, damping down our resentment of someone who has
unjustly harmed a nasty victim.]

Sometimes indeed we both punish and approve of punish-
ment purely on the grounds of the general interests of society,
interests that we think can’t be secured without the punish-
ment in question. All the punishments inﬂicted for breaches
of. . . .military discipline are examples of this. Such crimes
don’t immediately or directly harm any particular person;
but it is thought that their remote consequences will or might
included great harm to society. A sentinel who falls asleep

50

Smith on Moral Sentiments

Utility of this constitution

on his watch suffers death by the laws of war, because such
carelessness might endanger the whole army. This severity
may often seem to be necessary, and therefore to be just and
proper. . . . Yet this punishment, however necessary it may
be, always appears to be excessively severe—a punishment
so great for a crime seemingly so small. . . . A humane person
must gather his thoughts, make an effort, and exert his
whole ﬁrmness and resolution before he can bring himself
either to inﬂict such a punishment or to go along with its
being inﬂicted by others. This is different from his view
of just punishment of an ungrateful murderer or parricide,
where his heart vigorously—even joyfully—applauds the just
retaliation that seems right for such detestable crimes. . . .
The very different sentiments with which the spectator views
those different punishments shows that his approvals in
the two cases are not based on the same principles. The
spectator looks on the sentinel as an unfortunate victim,
who indeed ought to be devoted to the safety of numbers,
but whom still in his heart he would be glad to save; and

he is only sorry that the interest of the many should oppose
his being let off. But if the murderer escaped punishment,
this would arouse the spectator’s highest indignation, and
he would call on God to avenge in another world the crime
that mankind had wrongly neglected to punish on earth.

·A propos of that last point·: Notice that we’re so far from
imagining that injustice ought to be punished in this life
merely in the interests of social order that can’t otherwise be
maintained, that •Nature teaches us to hope, and •religion
(we suppose) authorises us to expect, that it will be punished
even in a life to come. One might say that our sense of its ill
desert pursues it beyond the grave, though the example
of its punishment there can’t serve to deter the rest of
mankind—who don’t see it, and don’t know it—from being
guilty of similar conduct here. But we think that the God’s
justice requires that he should hereafter avenge the injuries
of the widow and the fatherless, who are so often harmed
with impunity in this life. . . .

Causes of the inﬂuence of luck

Section 3: The inﬂuence of luck on mankind’s sentiments regarding the merit or demerit of actions

Whatever praise or blame can be due to any action must

be based on

(1) the intention or affection of the heart from which
the action comes,
(2) the external action or movement of the body which
this affection causes, or
(3) the good or bad consequences that actually come
from it.

These three constitute the whole nature and circumstances
of the action, and must be the basis for any quality that
belongs to it.

It is abundantly evident that (2) and (3) can’t be a basis
for any praise or blame, and no-one has ever said that
they could. The (2) external action or movement of the
body is often the same in the most innocent and in the
most blameworthy actions. •Shooting a bird, •shooting a
man—these are the same external movement, pulling the
trigger of a gun. And (3) the consequences that actually
happen to come from an action are as irrelevant to praise
and blame as is the external movement of the body—even
more irrelevant if that is possible! The consequences of the
action depend not on the agent but on luck [Smith’s word, here
and throughout, is ‘fortune’], so they can’t be the proper basis for
any sentiment of which the agent’s character and conduct
are the objects.

The only consequences for which he is accountable, or
by which he can deserve either approval or disapproval of
any kind, are ones that were in some way intended, or ·if not
outright intended, then· at least show some agreeable or dis-
agreeable quality in the intention from which the agent acted.
So there we have it: any judgment of the action’s rightness

or wrongness, its beneﬁcence or harmfulness of design, any
praise or blame for it, any approval or disapproval, is just
only if it is based on the intention or affection of the heart
from which the action arose.

Everyone agrees with this thesis when it is stated, as
here, in abstract and general terms; its obvious rightness
is acknowledged by all the world, with no dissenting voice
among all mankind. Everyone accepts that the accidental,
unintended and unforeseen consequences of an action, how-
ever good they are, don’t make the action a suitable object
of gratitude if the intention or affection was malevolent; and
however bad they are, they don’t make the action a suitable
object of resentment if the intention or affection was good.

But however sure we are about this, stated in the ab-
stract, when we get down to particular cases our sentiments
concerning the merit or demerit of an action are in fact
greatly affected—in one direction or the other—by what
actual consequences happened to come from it. We all
accept the rule that actual consequences are irrelevant to
an action’s moral status, and yet it hardly ever happens that
our ·moral· sentiments are entirely regulated by it. This is
an irregularity of sentiment that

everyone feels,
hardly anyone is sufﬁciently aware of, and
nobody is willing to acknowledge.

I now proceed to explain it, ·in three chapters, in which· I
shall discuss (1) the cause of this irregularity, (2) the extent
of its inﬂuence, and (3) the end purpose that ·God·, the
Author of nature, seems to have intended by it.

52

Smith on Moral Sentiments

Causes of the inﬂuence of luck

Chapter 1: The causes of this inﬂuence of luck

All causes of pain and pleasure—all of them—seem to im-
mediately arouse gratitude and resentment in all animals.
Those passions are aroused by inanimate as well as by
animate objects. We are brieﬂy angry even with the stone that
hurts us; a child beats it, a dog barks at it, a bad-tempered
man is apt to curse it. A moment’s thought corrects this
sentiment, making us realize that something that has no
feeling is a very improper object of revenge! But when great
harm has been done by an inanimate object, that object
becomes disagreeable to us ever after, and we take pleasure
in burning or destroying it. That is how we would treat
something that had accidentally been the cause of the death
of a friend, and we would often think ourselves guilty of
a sort of inhumanity if we didn’t vent this absurd sort of
vengeance on it.

In the same way we have a sort of gratitude for inanimate
objects that have caused great pleasure or frequent pleasure.
The sailor escapes from a shipwreck with the help of a plank;
if as soon as he gets back to land he uses the plank as
ﬁrewood, he will strike us as being guilty of an unnatural
action. We would have expected him to preserve the plank
with care and affection, as a monument that was dear to
him. After years of using a snuff-box, a pen-knife, and a
walking-stick, a man grows fond of them and feels something
like a real love and affection for them. If he breaks or loses
them, he is upset out of all proportion to the value of the
damage. The house that we have long lived in, and the tree
whose green shade we have long enjoyed, are both looked
on with a sort of respect that such benefactors seem to be
owed. The decay of the house or the death of the tree affects
us with a kind of melancholy, even though it doesn’t bring
any loss to us. . . .

But for something to be a proper object of gratitude or
resentment it must not only •cause pleasure or pain but
must also •be capable of feeling them. If it doesn’t have this
capacity, there’s no way for gratitude or resentment to be
satisﬁed in relation to it. Having been aroused by the causes
of pleasure and pain, those passions can be satisﬁed only
by retaliating those sensations on what caused them; and
there’s no point in trying to do that with an object that isn’t
sentient. So animals are less improper objects of gratitude
and resentment than inanimate objects. The dog that bites,
the ox that gores, are both of them punished. If an animal
causes someone’s death, neither that person’s relatives or
the public in general will be satisﬁed unless the animal
is put to death in its turn; not merely for •the security of
the living, but also to some extent to •revenge the injury
of the dead. On the other hand, animals that have been
remarkably serviceable to their masters become objects of a
lively gratitude. . . .

But. . . .animals are still far from being complete and
perfect objects of gratitude or resentment. What gratitude
wants most is not only •to make the benefactor feel pleasure
in his turn, but •to make him aware that he is being rewarded
for his past conduct, to make him pleased with that conduct,
and to convince him that the person he helped was worth
helping. What charms us most about our benefactor is
the match between his sentiments and ours concerning the
worth of our own character and the respect that is due to
us. We are delighted to ﬁnd someone who values us as we
value ourselves, and picks us out from the rest of mankind
in somewhat the way in which we pick out ourselves! One of
our main purposes in rewarding him is to maintain in him
these agreeable and ﬂattering sentiments (though the best
of us won’t pursue this with the further purpose of getting
new favours from the benefactor). And this is the reason

53

Smith on Moral Sentiments

Extent of luck’s inﬂuence

for something that I pointed out earlier, namely that when
we can’t enter into the motives of our benefactor, when his
conduct and character appear unworthy of our approval, our
gratitude for his services to us—however great they have
been—is signiﬁcantly lessened. We are less ﬂattered by his
picking us out for special favour; and keeping the respect of
such a weak or worthless patron seems not to be something
worth pursuing for its own sake.

On the other hand, the chief purpose of resentment is
not merely to make our enemy feel pain in his turn, but
to make him aware that he is feeling pain because of his
past conduct, to make him repent of that conduct, and to
make him feel that the person he injured didn’t deserve to
be treated in that manner. What chieﬂy enrages us against
the man who injures or insults us is his writing us off as
insigniﬁcant, his unreasonable preference for himself over
us, and the absurd self-love that apparently leads him to
imagine that other people may be sacriﬁced at any time for
his convenience or at his whim. The glaring impropriety of
this conduct, the gross insolence and injustice that it seems
to involve, often shock and exasperate us more than all the
harm that we have suffered. To bring him back to a better
sense of what is due to other people, to make him aware of
what he owes us and of the wrong that he has done to us,
is often the main purpose of our revenge, which is always
incomplete when it can’t accomplish this. . . .

Thus, before anything can be a complete and proper
object of either gratitude or resentment it must possess
(1) It must be the cause of
three different qualiﬁcations.
pleasure in one case, of pain in the other.
(2) It must be
capable of feeling those sensations. (3) It must not merely
have produced those sensations but must have done so
from design—a design that is approved of in one case and
disapproved of in the other.
It’s (1) that makes an object

capable of arousing gratitude and resentment; it’s because
of (2) that these passions can in some way be satisﬁed; and
(3) is not only needed for the gratitude or resentment to be
complete, but also provides an extra cause of those passions
because of the special and intense pleasure or pain that it
involves.

The sole arousing cause of gratitude is something that
gives pleasure; so that even when a person’s intentions are
utterly proper and beneﬁcent, if he has failed actually to
produce the good that he intended, less gratitude seems to
be due to him because one of the arousing causes is lacking.
And the sole arousing cause of resentment is something
that gives pain; so that even when a person’s intentions are
utterly improper and malevolent, if he has failed actually to
produce the evil that he intended, less resentment seems
to be due to him because one of the arousing causes is
lacking.
[Smith really does move from ‘the sole cause’ to ‘one of the
causes’, a move that he needs for his conclusion about ‘less’ gratitude or
resentment rather than none.] On the other hand, even when
a person’s intentions don’t have any laudable degree of
benevolence, if his actions happen to produce great good,
because one of the arousing causes has occurred some
gratitude is apt to arise towards him—a shadow of merit
seems to fall on him. And when a person’s intentions don’t
have any blameworthy degree of malice, if his actions should
happen to produce great evil, because one of the arousing
causes has occurred some resentment is apt to arise towards
him—a shadow of demerit seems to fall on him. And, as the
consequences of actions are entirely under the dominance
of luck [remember that Smith’s word throughout is ‘fortune’], what I
have been describing is the source of luck’s inﬂuence on the
sentiments of mankind regarding merit and demerit.

54

Smith on Moral Sentiments

Extent of luck’s inﬂuence

Chapter 2: The extent of this inﬂuence of luck

The effect of this inﬂuence of luck is (1) to lessen our sense
of the merit or demerit of actions that arose from praisewor-
thy or blameworthy intentions but failed to produce their
intended effects; and (2) to increase our sense of the merit
or demerit of actions, beyond what is due to the motives
or affections that they come from, when they accidentally
give rise to either extraordinary pleasure or extraordinary
pain. ·This chapter will be devoted to discussions of these
two effects·.

(1) To repeat the point: however proper and beneﬁcent
(or improper and malevolent) a person’s intentions in acting
are, if the intended effect doesn’t happen his merit seems
imperfect (or his demerit seems incomplete). This irregularity
of sentiment is felt not only •by those who are immediately
affected by the consequences of the action in question
but also to some extent even •by the impartial spectator.
·In discussing this matter, I shall start with failed •good
intentions and then turn to failed •bad ones·.

(1a). . . .It is often said that we are equally obliged to •a
man who has tried to help us and to •one who actually did
so. That’s the speech that we regularly make after every
unsuccessful attempt of this kind; but like all other ﬁne
speeches it mustn’t be taken too strictly. The sentiments
that a generous-minded man has for the friend who fails ·to
help him· may often be nearly the same as what he feels
for the one who succeeds; and the more generous he is the
nearer his sentiments will come to that level. [For ‘generous’
see note on page 11.] A truly generous-minded man will get
more pleasure from—and be more grateful for—•the love
and respect he gets from people he thinks to be worthy of
respect than for all the •advantages he can ever expect to
ﬂow from that love and respect. So when he loses those

advantages he seems to be losing only a triﬂe that is hardly
worth thinking about. But still he does lose something, so
that his pleasure and gratitude are not perfectly complete.
Therefore, as between the friend who fails and the friend
who succeeds, other things being equal, the noblest and best
mind will have some little difference of affection in favour of
the one who succeeds. Indeed, people are so unjust about
this that even when the intended beneﬁt is procured, they
are apt to think that less gratitude is due to the benefactor if
he wasn’t the sole producer of the beneﬁt. . . .

Even the merit of talents and abilities that some accident
has prevented from producing their effects seems somewhat
imperfect, even to people who are fully convinced that the
person does have the capacity to produce those effects.
[Smith gives the example of a general whose battle plans
were excellent but who is robbed of victory by political
interference from his own side:] Although he might deserve
all the approval that is due to a great military plan, he still
lacks the actual merit of having performed a great action. . . .
It angers an architect when his plans are either not carried
out at all, or carried out with so many alterations that the
effect of the building is spoiled. The only thing that depends
on the architect is the plan; and good judges can see his
genius being revealed in that as completely as in the actual
building. But even to those who know most about such
things a •plan doesn’t give the same pleasure as does a
•noble and magniﬁcent building. . . . There may be many
men of whom we believe ‘He is more talented than Caesar
and Alexander; placed in the situations they were in, he
would perform still greater feats’. But in the mean time,
however, we don’t view such a man with the wonder and
admiration with which those two heroes have been regarded
in all ages and nations. The calm judgments of the mind
may approve of him more, but the mind isn’t dazzled and

55

Smith on Moral Sentiments

Extent of luck’s inﬂuence

carried away by the splendour of great actions. . . .

(1b) Just as the merit of an unsuccessful attempt to do
good seems to ungrateful mankind to be lessened if the
attempt fails, so also does the demerit of an unsuccessful
attempt to do evil. The plan to commit a crime, however
clearly it is proved to exist, is hardly ever punished with
the same severity as the actual commission of the crime.
The only exception to this may be the crime of treason.
Because that crime immediately affects the existence of the
government itself, the government is naturally more touchy
about it than about any other. When the sovereign punishes
•other crimes, he is acting on the resentment that he feels
through sympathy with the victims of the crimes. But when
he punishes •treason, he is acting on his own resentment
of harm done to himself. So that here he is judging in his
own cause, which makes him apt to be more violent and
bloody in his punishments than the impartial spectator can
approve of. Also, when treason is involved, it takes less to
trigger the sovereign’s resentment, which doesn’t always wait
for the committing of the crime or even for the attempt to
commit it. A treasonable conspiracy, though nothing has
been done or even attempted as a result of it—indeed a mere
treasonable conversation—is in many countries punished in
the same way as the actual commission of treason. With any
other crime, the mere design—with no attempt to carry it
through—is seldom punished at all, and is never punished
severely. This may be said:

‘A criminal •design doesn’t necessarily involve the
same degree of depravity as a criminal •action, and
therefore shouldn’t be subjected to the same punish-
ment. We are capable of •deciding, and even of taking
steps towards performing, many things that—when
it comes to the point—we feel ourselves entirely inca-
pable of •doing.’

But this line of thought doesn’t apply when the design
has been carried through to the last attempt. Yet there
is hardly any country where the man who ﬁres a pistol
at his enemy but misses him is punished with death. . . .
But mankind’s resentment against the crime of murder is
so intense, and their fear of the man who shows himself
capable of committing it is so great, that the mere attempt to
commit it ought in all countries to be a capital offence. The
attempt to commit smaller crimes is almost always punished
lightly, and sometimes is not punished at all. The thief
whose hand has been caught in his neighbour’s pocket
before he had taken anything out of it is punished only
with the disgrace of being exposed as a thief; if he’d had
time to steal a handkerchief, he would have been put to
death. The burglar who has been found setting a ladder to
his neighbour’s window but hasn’t gone through the window
is not exposed to capital punishment. The attempt to ravish
a woman is not punished as a rape. The attempt to seduce a
married woman is not punished at all, though ·successful·
seduction is punished severely. Our resentment against
someone who tried and failed to commit a crime is seldom
strong enough to lead us to punishment in the way we would
have thought proper if he had succeeded.
In the failure
case, our joy at being spared the actual crime alleviates
•our sense of the atrocity of his conduct; in the success
case, the grief of our misfortune increases •it. Yet his real
demerit is undoubtedly the same in both cases, since his
intentions were equally criminal; and there is in this respect,
therefore, an irregularity in the sentiments of all men, and a
consequent relaxation of discipline in the laws of, I believe, all
nations the most civilized as well as the most barbarous. [The
‘irregularity’ Smith speaks of is just the phenomenon of our accepting
a general rule—Latin regula—and then having sentiments that don’t
conform to it. We’ll meet the term again.]. . . .

56

Smith on Moral Sentiments

Extent of luck’s inﬂuence

[Smith next writes about the fundamentally decent person
who somehow gets involved in planning a crime, and is
prevented from succeeding by some accident. He must think
that this was a lucky rescue, saving him from spending ‘the
rest of his life in horror, remorse, and repentance’. He knows
that his heart is as guilty as it would have been if he had
succeeded, but his failure to commit the crime eases his
conscience so that he ‘considers himself as less deserving of
punishment and resentment’ than he would have been if he
has succeeded.]

(2) The second effect of this inﬂuence of luck is to increase
our sense of the merit (or demerit) of actions beyond what is
due to the motives or feelings that produce them, when they
happen to cause extraordinary pleasure (or pain). . . . For
example, a messenger who brings bad news is disagreeable
to us, whereas we feel a sort of gratitude to the man who
brings us good news. For a moment we regard them as the
authors of our good fortune (in one case) and of our bad
fortune (in the other), looking at them rather as though they
had really brought about the events that they only report to
us.
[Smith goes into some details about this, concluding
thus:] King Tigranes of Armenia struck off the head of the
man who brought him the ﬁrst account of the approach of
a formidable enemy. To punish the bringer of bad news
in this way seems barbarous and inhuman; but rewarding
the messenger bringing good news is not disagreeable to
us—we think it suitable to the generosity of kings. Why
do we make this distinction when if there’s no fault in the
one there’s no merit in the other? It is because any sort
of reason seems sufﬁcient to authorize the expressing of
the social and benevolent affections, whereas it requires the
most solid and substantial reasons to make us sympathetic
to the expression of unsocial and malevolent ones.

. . . .There is a class of exceptions to this general rule that
no-one should be punished for conduct that wasn’t based on
malicious and unjust intentions. When someone’s negligence
has caused unintended harm to someone else, we generally
enter into the sufferer’s resentment far enough to approve of
his punishing the offender far more than his offence would
have appeared to deserve if no such unlucky consequence
had followed from it.

There is a level of negligence that would appear to deserve
some punishment even if it didn’t harm anyone, Suppose
someone threw a large stone over a wall into a public street,
without warning anyone and without considering where it
was likely to fall. He would undoubtedly deserve some
punishment. A really precise penal law would punish this
absurd action even if it did no harm. The person who is
guilty of it shows that he insolently regards the happiness
and safety of others as negligible. There is real injustice
in his conduct. He recklessly exposes his neighbour to a
risk that no man in his senses would choose to expose
himself to, and evidently lacks the sense of what is due
to his fellow-creatures that is the basis of justice and of
society. Gross negligence therefore is said in the law to be
almost equal to malicious design. When such carelessness
happens to have bad consequences, the guilty person is often
punished as if he had really intended those consequences;
and his conduct, which was really only •thoughtless and
insolent and deserving of some punishment, is considered
as •atrocious and as liable to the severest punishment. If
the stone-throwing action that I have mentioned should acci-
dentally kill a man, the laws of many countries—particularly
by the old law of Scotland—will condemn the stone-thrower
to death. This is no doubt too severe, but it’s not altogether
inconsistent with our natural sentiments. Our just indigna-
tion against the folly and inhumanity of the man’s conduct

57

Smith on Moral Sentiments

The purpose of this irregularity

is intensiﬁed by our sympathy with the unfortunate sufferer.
But nothing would appear more shocking to our natural
sense of fairness than to bring a man to the scaffold merely
for having thrown a stone carelessly into the street without
harming any body. The folly and inhumanity of his conduct
would be the same in this case ·as in the case where a
passer-by is killed by the stone·, but our sentiments would
be different. Thinking about this difference can show us how
much the indignation of the spectator is apt to be worked
up by the actual consequences of the action. In cases of this
kind. I think, there is a great degree of severity in the laws
of almost all nations. . . .

There’s another degree of negligence that doesn’t involve
in it any sort of injustice. The person who is guilty of it
treats his neighbours as he treats himself, means no harm
to anyone, and is far from having an insolent disregard for
the safety and happiness of others. But he isn’t as careful
and circumspect in his conduct as he ought to be, and for
that reason he deserves some kind of blame and censure,
but no sort of punishment. However, if by a negligence of this
kind he causes harm to another person, the laws of every
country (I believe) will require him to pay compensation.
No doubt this is a real punishment, and no-one would have
thought of inﬂicting it on him if it hadn’t been for the unlucky
accident that his conduct caused; yet this decision of the
law is approved of by the natural sentiments of all mankind.
Nothing, we think, can be more just than that one man
should not suffer through someone else’s carelessness, and
that the damage caused by culpable negligence should be
paid for by the person who was guilty of it.

[Smith now gives us a whole page about a still lower level
of negligence, which consists in not acting with ‘the most
anxious timidity and circumspection’, i.e. with a kind of
caution that would be a fault, not a virtue—a fault because

life can’t satisfactorily be lived with that much concern for
possible bad consequences.
If one person hurts another
through this kind of ‘negligence’, it is usual and natural
for him to apologize and express his concern for the suf-
ferer’s welfare, and (if he is a decent person) he will offer
compensation for the damage he has done and do what he
can to soothe the resentment that the sufferer is likely to
feel. Smith continues:] To make no apology, to offer no
atonement, is regarded ·by us all· as the highest brutality.
Yet why should he apologize more than anyone else? Why
should he, since he was as innocent as any other bystander,
be thus singled out from among all mankind to make up
for someone else’s bad luck? This task wouldn’t have been
imposed on him if it weren’t for the fact that the impartial
spectator feels some indulgence for what may be regarded
as the unjust resentment of the sufferer.
[Here and in one
other place, Smith speaks of ‘animal resentment’, evidently meaning
‘resentment that is natural but not defensible through any acceptable
general moral principles’.]

Chapter 3: The purpose of this irregularity of senti-
ments

That is how the good or bad consequences of an action
affect the sentiments both of the agent and of others; so
that is how luck [‘fortune’], which governs the world, has
inﬂuence in the area where we should be least willing to
allow it any, and partly directs the sentiments of mankind
regarding the character and conduct both of themselves and
of others. Everyone judges by the outcome, and not by the
design—that has been the complaint down through the ages,
and is the great discouragement of virtue. Everyone agrees
to the •general maxim that because the outcome doesn’t
depend on the agent it oughtn’t to inﬂuence our sentiments

58

Smith on Moral Sentiments

The purpose of this irregularity

regarding the merit or propriety of his conduct. But our
sentiments in •particular cases almost never exactly conform
to what this reasonable maxim would require. The happy or
unprosperous outcome of any action not only •is apt to give
us a good or bad opinion of the prudence with which it was
conducted, but nearly always also •sparks our gratitude or
resentment, our sense of the merit or demerit of the design.
But when Nature planted the seeds of this irregularity
in the human breast, she seems to have intended—as she
always does—the happiness and perfection of our species. If
the only causes of our •resentment were the harmfulness of
the design and the malevolence of the affection, we would
feel all the furies of •that passion against anyone whom
we suspected of having such designs or affections, even if
they had never broken out into any action. Sentiments,
thoughts, intentions, would become objects of punishment;
and if the indignation of mankind ran as high against them
as against actions—if the baseness of a •thought that didn’t
lead to any action seemed to us all to call as loudly for
vengeance as the baseness of the •action—every court of law
would become a real inquisition. There would be no safety
for the most innocent and cautious conduct. Bad wishes,
bad views, bad designs, might still be suspected. . . .and
would expose the person to punishment and resentment
just as bad actions do. So the Author of nature has seen
to it that the only proper and approved objects of human
punishment and resentment are actions—actions that either
•produce actual evil or •try to produce it and thereby put us
in the immediate fear of it. According to cool reason, human
actions derive their whole merit or demerit from •sentiments,
designs, affections; but ·God·, the great Judge of hearts has
placed •these outside the scope of every human jurisdiction,
reserving them to be considered in his own unerring tribunal.
This salutary and useful irregularity in human sentiments

regarding merit or demerit, which at ﬁrst sight appears so
absurd and indefensible, is the basis for the necessary rule of
justice that men in this life are liable to punishment only for
their actions and not for their designs and intentions. In fact,
when we look carefully into any part of nature we ﬁnd this
sort of evidence of the providential care of its Author—we
can admire the wisdom and goodness of God even in the
weakness and folly of man.

Here’s another irregularity of sentiments that has some
utility: the merit of an unsuccessful attempt to do something
good appears to be imperfect; and the merit of mere good
inclinations and kind wishes is even more so. Man was made
for action—to exercise his faculties to promote changes in
the external circumstances both of himself and others in
ways that seem most favourable to the happiness of all. He
mustn’t be satisﬁed with slack benevolence, or see himself
as the friend of mankind because in his heart he wishes well
to the prosperity of the world! The purpose of his existence is
to produce certain states of affairs; Nature wants him to call
forth the whole vigour of his soul and to strain every nerve
to produce them; so she has taught him that neither he nor
anyone else can whole-heartedly applaud or be fully satisﬁed
with his conduct unless he actually produces them. . . . The
man who hasn’t performed a single action of importance, but
whose whole conversation and manner express the justest,
the noblest, and most generous sentiments, isn’t entitled to
demand any high reward even if his inutility is purely due
to his having had no opportunity to serve. . . . We can still
ask him: ‘What have you done? What actual service can you
point to that entitles you to such a large reward? We respect
you and love you, but we don’t owe you anything.’ It would
take •the most divine benevolence to reward the virtue that
has been useless only because there has been no opportunity
to serve, giving it the honours and preferments that it may

59

Smith on Moral Sentiments

The purpose of this irregularity

be said to deserve but wasn’t entitled to insist on. On the
other hand, to punish mere affections of the heart where
no crime has been committed is •insolent and barbarous
tyranny. The benevolent affections seem to deserve most
praise when they are acted on quickly (rather than being
delayed until it becomes almost a crime not to act on them!);
whereas it’s almost impossible for a malevolent affection to
be too tardy, too slow, or deliberate in being acted on.

It is important that the evil that is done without design
should be regarded as a misfortune to the doer as well as
to the sufferer. By having that attitude, man is taught to
reverence the happiness of his brethren, to tremble lest he
should unknowingly do anything that can harm them, and
to fear the animal resentment that he feels is ready to burst
out against him if he should unintentionally be the unhappy
instrument of their calamity. ·Here is a kind of model or
metaphor for the point I want to make·:

In the ancient heathen religion, holy ground that
had been consecrated to some god was not to be
walked on except on solemn and necessary occasions.
Someone who violated this, even if he did it in igno-
rance, became piacular from that moment, and until
proper atonement was made he was vulnerable to
the vengeance of the powerful and invisible being for
whom that ground had been set apart.

[To be ‘piacular’ is to be in a state in which one needs to make atonement,
to expiate, for something one has done.] Now compare that with
this:

By the wisdom of Nature the happiness of every
innocent man is made holy, consecrated, hedged
round against the approach of every other man; not to
be wantonly walked on, and not even to be in any
way violated, even ignorantly and unintentionally,
without requiring some expiation, some atonement

60

in proportion to the magnitude of the unintended
violation.

A humane man who accidentally and with absolutely no
blameworthy negligence has been the cause of the death of
another man feels that he is •piacular, though not •guilty.
During his whole life he regards this accident as one of the
greatest misfortunes that could have befallen him. If the
family of the slain man is poor and he himself is fairly well
off, he immediately takes them under his protection. . . .and
thinks them entitled to every degree of favour and kindness.
If they are wealthier than he is, he tries by every submission,
by every expression of sorrow, by giving them any service
that he can devise and they will accept, to atone for what
has happened and to placate as much as possible their
resentment for the great though unintended offence that he
has given them. (Their resentment is certainly most unjust,
but it is also natural.)

[Smith adds a paragraph about the role of this aspect
of the human condition—‘this fallacious sense of guilt’—in
theatrical drama. Of Oedipus and Jocasta he says that they
are both ‘in the highest degree piacular’ though neither is ‘in
the smallest degree guilty’.]

Despite all these seeming irregularities of sentiment, if a
man has the bad luck to cause evils that he didn’t intend, or
to fail in producing good that he did intend, Nature hasn’t
left his innocence with no consolation or his virtue with no
reward. What the man does is to get help from that just
and equitable maxim: Outcomes that didn’t depend on our
conduct ought not to lessen the respect that is due to us. He
summons up his whole magnanimity and ﬁrmness of soul,
and works to regard himself not in the light in which he does
at present appear, but in the light

Smith on Moral Sentiments

The purpose of this irregularity

•in which he ought to appear,
•in which he would have appeared if his generous plans
had met with success, and
•in which he would be appearing now, despite the
plans’ failure, if mankind’s sentiments were entirely
just and fair, or even entirely consistent with them-
selves.

The more just and humane part of mankind entirely go along
with this effort he is making to support himself in his own
opinion. They exert their whole generosity of mind to correct
in themselves this irregularity of human nature, and try
to regard his unlucky good intention in the light in which,
if it had been successful, they would have been naturally
disposed to consider it, without any such moral effort.

Smith on Moral Sentiments

Self-(dis)approval

Part III: The basis for our judgments about our own feelings

and behaviour; the sense of duty

Chapter 1: The principle of self-approval and self-
disapproval

Up to here I have chieﬂy considered the origin and foundation
of our judgments concerning the sentiments and conduct of
others. I now turn to the origin of our judgments concerning
our own sentiments and conduct.

The principle by which we naturally either approve or
disapprove of our own conduct seems to be exactly the
one by which we make such judgments about the conduct
of other people. We approve (or disapprove) of another
man’s conduct according to whether, when we bring his
case home to ourselves, we feel that we can (or cannot)
entirely sympathize with the sentiments and motives that
directed it. And in the same way we approve (or disapprove)
of our own conduct according to whether, when we adopt
the situation of a spectator, viewing our conduct with his
eyes (so to speak) and from his standpoint, we feel that we
can (or cannot) entirely enter into and sympathize with the
sentiments and motives that inﬂuenced it. The only way we
can survey our own •sentiments and motives, and the only
way we can form any judgment about them, is to remove
ourselves (so to speak) from our own natural station and try
to view •them as from a certain distance; and our only way
of doing that is by trying to view them with the eyes of other
people, or as other people are likely to view them. Thus, any
judgment we form about our own conduct tacitly refers to
what others

•do judge concerning them,
•would judge concerning them if certain conditions
were satisﬁed, or
•ought to judge concerning them.

We try to examine our own conduct as we imagine any other
fair and impartial spectator would examine it. If when we
place ourselves in his situation we thoroughly enter into all
the passions and motives that inﬂuenced it, we approve of it
by sympathy with the approval of this supposed fair judge.
If otherwise, we enter into his disapproval, and condemn
·I’ll restate the ‘approval’ side of this story
the conduct.
in different terms, just to make sure that it’s clear to you.
My judgment that my conduct is morally proper involves
two exercises of sympathy:
(1) the imagined spectator’s
sympathy with my actual motives and feelings, which leads
to his having such feelings; then (2) my sympathy with those
feelings of the spectator’s. So I can enter into the mind-set
that led me to act as I did by entering into an imagined
mind-set that enters into the actual mind-set that led me to
act·.

If it were possible for a human creature to grow to
adulthood without any communication with other humans,
he couldn’t have thoughts about •his own character, about
the propriety or demerit of •his own sentiments and conduct,
about •the beauty or ugliness of his own mind, any more than
he could think about •the beauty or ugliness of his own face.
These are all things that he can’t easily see and naturally
doesn’t look at, and he isn’t equipped with any mirror that

62

Smith on Moral Sentiments

Self-(dis)approval

can present them to his view. But now bring him into society,
and he immediately has the mirror that he lacked before.
It is placed in the faces and behaviour of those he lives
with, which always signal when those people enter into his
sentiments and when they disapprove of them; and that is
what gives him his ﬁrst view of the propriety and impropriety
of his own passions, the beauty and ugliness of his own mind.
·I have been talking about how hard it would be for a solitary
man to think about his own motives and conduct, but as
well as being hard it would be uninteresting for him to do
so·. If a man had been from his birth a stranger to society,
his whole attention would be focussed on the objects of his
passions, the external bodies that either pleased or harmed
him. As for those passions themselves. . . ., although they
would be more immediately present to him than anything
else, he would hardly ever think about them. The idea of
them couldn’t interest him enough to call on his attentive
consideration. The thought of his •joy couldn’t cause any
new joy, or the idea of his •sorrow any new sorrow, although
thoughts about the causes of •those passions might often
arouse both. But then, bring him into society and all his
own passions will immediately become the causes of new
passions. He will observe that mankind approve of some of
them, and this will elate him; and that they are disgusted by
others, which will cast him down. His desires and aversions,
his joys and sorrows, will now often cause new desires and
new aversions, new joys and new sorrows; so they will now
interest him deeply, and often call on his most attentive
consideration. [In this paragraph, the notion of what will ‘interest’ the
man may be partly the notion of what will be in his interests.]

[Smith now compares that with our thoughts about our
own physical beauty or ugliness, summing up thus:] It’s
obvious that we are concerned about our own beauty and
ugliness only because of its effect on others. If we had no

connection with society, we would be altogether indifferent
about both.

In the same way our ﬁrst moral criticisms are directed
at the characters and conduct of other people; and we are
all conscious of how each of these affects us. But we soon
learn that other people are equally frank about our own
character and conduct. We become concerned to know how
far we deserve their censure or applause. . . . So we start
to examine our own passions and conduct, and to think
about how these must appear to them by thinking about
how they would appear to us if we were in the situation of
the others. We suppose ourselves to be the spectators of our
own behaviour, and try to imagine what effect our conduct
would have on us when seen in this light. That’s the only
mirror in which we can, with the eyes of other people, have
some kind of view of the propriety of our own conduct. . . .

Whenever I try to examine my own conduct—whenever I
try to pass sentence on it, and either approve or condemn
it—it’s obvious •that I divide myself into two persons (so
to speak), and •that in my role as examiner and judge I
represent a different character [Smith’s exact phrase] from that
of myself as the person whose conduct is examined and
judged. One is the spectator, whose sentiments concerning
•my own conduct I try to enter into by placing myself in
his situation and considering how •it would appear to me
when seen from that particular point of view. The other
is the agent, the person whom I properly call ‘myself’, the
person about whose conduct I as spectator was trying to
form some opinion. The ﬁrst is the judge, the second the
person judged. But the judge can’t be in every respect the
same as the person judged of, any more than a cause can be
in every respect the same as the effect.

To be likeable and to be praiseworthy—i.e. to deserve
love and to deserve reward—are the great characters [Smith’s

63

Smith on Moral Sentiments

Love of praise, dread of blame

word] of virtue; and to be odious and punishable are the great
characters of vice. But all these characters immediately bring
in the sentiments of others. Virtue is said to be likeable or
praiseworthy not •because it is an object of its own love
or gratitude but •because it arouses those sentiments in
other men. The inward tranquillity and self-satisfaction that
naturally accompany virtue are caused by the awareness of
being an object of such favourable regards, just as the inner
torment that naturally accompanies vice results from the
suspicion that one is viewed with disfavour. What can be a
greater happiness than to be beloved, and to know that we
deserve to be beloved? What can be a greater misery than to
be hated, and to know that we deserve to be hated?

Chapter 2: The love of praise and of praiseworthi-
ness; the dread of blame and of blameworthiness

Man naturally desire, not only to be loved but to be lovely,
i.e. to be a natural and proper object of love. He naturally
fears not only to be hated but to be hateful, i.e. a natural
and proper object of hatred. [That used to be the only standard
meaning of ‘hateful’;
is still is standard except in the USA where a
‘hateful’ person is one who is full of hate.] He wants not only praise
but praiseworthiness, i.e. to be a natural and proper object of
praise, whether or not anyone actually praises him. He fears
not only blame but blameworthiness, i.e. to be a natural
and proper object of blame, whether or not anyone actually
blames him.

The love of praiseworthiness is emphatically not derived
solely from the love of praise. Those two drives resemble one
another, are connected, and often blend with one another,
but they are in many respects distinct and independent of
one another.

The love and admiration that we naturally have for those

whose character and conduct we approve of necessarily lead
us to want to become, ourselves, objects of such agreeable
sentiments, and to be as likeable and admirable as those
whom we love and admire the most. Our intense desire to
excel is based on our admiration of the excellence of others.
And we aren’t satisﬁed with being merely admired for quali-
ties that get other people to be •admired; we have to at least
believe that we are admirable for qualities that make other
people •admirable. But to satisfy this desire we must become
the impartial spectators of our own character and conduct,
trying to view them with other peoples’ eyes, or as other
people are likely to view them. If our character and conduct
when seen in this light appear to us as we wish, we are
happy and contented. But this happiness and contentment
are greatly conﬁrmed if we ﬁnd that other people, when they
view our character and conduct with the actual eyes that we
were only imagining ourselves viewing them with, see them
in precisely the way we had imagined ourselves seeing them.
This approval from other people necessarily conﬁrms our
own self-approval. Their praise necessarily strengthens our
own sense of our praiseworthiness. In this case, far from
the love of praiseworthiness being derived solely from the
love of praise, the love of praise seems to a large extent to be
derived from the love of praiseworthiness.

The most sincere praise can’t give us much pleasure when
it can’t be regarded as evidence that we are praiseworthy. It
won’t satisfy us to have esteem and admiration bestowed on
us through some kind of ignorance or mistake. . . . The man
who applauds us either for actions that we didn’t perform or
for motives that had no inﬂuence on our conduct is really ap-
plauding not us but someone else. We can get no satisfaction
from that. That kind of praise should be more humiliating
than any blame, and should perpetually bring to our minds
the most humbling of all reﬂections, namely the thought of

64

Smith on Moral Sentiments

Love of praise, dread of blame

what we •ought to be but •are not. . . . To be pleased with
such groundless applause is a proof of the most superﬁcial
levity and weakness. It is what is properly called ‘vanity’,
and is the basis for the most ridiculous and contemptible
vices, namely the vices of affectation and common lying.
[Smith scornfully presents two examples: a fool who tries to
attract admiration by telling lying stories about adventures
he has come through, and the self-important idiot who
parades himself as someone with ‘rank and distinction’
that he knows he doesn’t have. Smith continues with an
acute psychological account of such people:] They look on
themselves not in •the light in which they know they ought
to appear to their companions, but in •the light in which
they believe their companions actually look on them. Their
superﬁcial weakness and trivial folly prevent them from ever
looking into themselves, seeing themselves in the way (their
consciences must tell them) that everyone would see them if
the real truth were known.

Matching the fact that ignorant and groundless praise
can give no solid joy, no satisfaction that will bear serious
examination, is the fact that

it is often really comforting to reﬂect that although no
praise has been actually bestowed on us, our conduct
has deserved praise, having entirely conformed to the
measures and rules by which praise and approval are
naturally and commonly bestowed.

We are pleased not only with praise but also with having
acted in a praiseworthy way. We are pleased to think that
we have made ourselves natural objects of approval, even
if no approval has ever actually been bestowed on us; just
as we are humiliated by the thought that we have deserved
the blame of those we live with, even if we have never been
actually blamed. The man who is aware of having behaved
in exactly the ways that experience tells him are generally

agreeable reﬂects with satisfaction on the propriety of •his
own behaviour. When he views •it in the light in which the
impartial spectator would view it, he thoroughly enters into
all the motives that inﬂuenced it. He looks back on every part
of it with pleasure and approval, and even if mankind are
never acquainted with what he has done, he looks at himself
not as they do regard him but as they would regard him if
they were better informed. . . . Men have voluntarily thrown
away life to acquire after death a renown that they could
no longer enjoy. While they still lived they imaginatively
anticipated the fame that was in future times to be bestowed
on them. The applause that they were never to hear rang
in their ears; and the thoughts of the admiration whose
effects they were never to feel •played about their hearts,
•banished from their breasts the strongest of all natural
fears, and •led them to perform actions that seem almost
beyond the reach of human nature. But in point of reality
there is surely no great difference between •the approval
that won’t be given until we can no longer enjoy it and •the
approval that won’t ever be given but would be if the world
ever came to understand properly the facts about how we
have behaved.
If the former often produces such violent
effects, it’s not surprising that the other should always be
highly regarded.

When Nature formed man for society, she endowed him
with (1) a basic desire to please his brethren and a basic
aversion to offending them. She taught him to feel pleasure
in their favourable regard and pain in their unfavourable
regard. She made their approval most ﬂattering and most
agreeable to him for its own sake, and their disapproval most
humiliating and most offensive.

But this alone wouldn’t have equipped him for the society
for which he was made. So Nature endowed him not only
with a desire to be approved of but also with (2) a desire to

65

Smith on Moral Sentiments

Love of praise, dread of blame

be something that ought to be approved of, or a desire to be
what he himself approves of in other men. Desire (1) could
only have made him wish to appear to be ﬁt for society; to be
concerned about really being ﬁt, he needed desire (2). . . . In
every well-formed mind desire (2) seems to be the stronger of
the two. Only the weakest and most superﬁcial of mankind
can be much delighted with praise that they themselves
know to be altogether unmerited. [Smith goes on at some
length about the attitude of ‘a wise man’, to whom what
matters above all is to deserve approval, whether or not he
actually gets it from anyone.]

To want praise when none is due—or even to accept
praise when it is not due—can only be the effect of the
most contemptible vanity. To want it when it is really due is
to want merely that a most essential act of justice should be
done to us. The love of just fame or true glory, even for its
own sake and independently of any advantage one might get
from it, is not unworthy even of a wise man. But such a man
sometimes neglects and even despises fame of that kind; and
he is most likely to do so when he is absolutely conﬁdent of
the perfect propriety of every part of his own conduct. When
this is so, his self-approval doesn’t need to be conﬁrmed by
the approval of other men. It is sufﬁcient on its own, and he
is contented with it. This self-approval is the principal object
(if not indeed the only one) about which he can or ought to
be concerned. The love of it is the love of virtue.

Just as the love and admiration that we naturally have
for some others dispose us to want to become ourselves
the proper objects of such agreeable sentiments, so also
the hatred and contempt that we equally naturally have
for some others dispose us, perhaps even more strongly, to
dread the very thought of resembling them in any respect.
And here again what we fear is less the thought of being
hated and despised than the thought of being hateful and

despicable. . . . The man who has broken through all the
measures of conduct that could make him agreeable to
mankind may have the most perfect assurance that what he
has done will for ever be concealed from every human eye;
but that won’t do him any good. When he looks back on his
behaviour and views with the eyes of an impartial spectator,
he ﬁnds that he can’t enter into any of the motives that
inﬂuenced it. He. . . .feels a high degree of the shame that he
would be exposed to if his actions were ever to be generally
known. . . . And if what he has been guilty of is not merely
wrong actions that would be objects of simple disapproval,
but an enormous crime that would arouse detestation and
resentment, he can never think of it. . . .without feeling all the
agony of horror and remorse. [Smith adds colourful detail
about the ‘natural pangs of an affrighted conscience’ that
can’t be allayed by convincing oneself that there is no God.
He says that some terrible criminals have confessed to their
crimes when they were not under suspicion. He continues
with this theme:] They hoped by their death •to reconcile
themselves, at least in their own imagination, to the natural
sentiments of mankind; •to be able to consider themselves
as less worthy of hatred and resentment; •to atone in some
measure for their crimes, and by thus becoming objects
of compassion rather than of horror, if possible •to die in
peace and with the forgiveness of all their fellow-creatures.
Compared to what they felt before the discovery, even the
thought of this, it seems, was happiness. . . .

Only the most frivolous and superﬁcial of mankind can
be much delighted with praise that they know they don’t in
the least deserve. But undeserved reproach is often capable
of humiliating even men of more than ordinary constancy. . . .
Such a man is humbled to ﬁnd that anyone should have
such a low view of his character as to suppose him capable
of being guilty of whatever it is he is accused of. Though he is

66

Smith on Moral Sentiments

Love of praise, dread of blame

perfectly conscious of his innocence, the very accusation of-
ten seems to throw—even in his own imagination—a shadow
of disgrace and dishonour on his character. . . . An innocent
man who is brought to the scaffold by the false accusation
of an odious crime suffers the cruelest misfortune that it is
possible for innocence to suffer. . . .

[For someone to whom this happens, Smith says, religion
offers some consolation:
the only thing that can ‘strike
terror into triumphant vice’ is also the only thing that offers
‘consolation to disgraced and insulted innocence’. There
is not much consolation to be drawn from ‘the humble
philosophy that conﬁnes its views to this life’.]

[Continuing with this enormously long chapter [25 book-
pages], Smith now presents two pages of details of how
various kinds of people handle (1) unmerited applause and
(2) unmerited disapproval.
Its main point is that a good
person won’t get pleasure from (1) but will get pain from (2).
If he tries to shrug either of these off by telling the world
‘I didn’t do it’, he is more likely to be believed in (1) than
in (2). And there’s something else that makes unmerited
disapproval hard for a good man to take:] He knows perfectly
what he has done, but perhaps no-one can know for sure
what he himself is capable of doing. . . . He may be conﬁdent
that the unfavourable judgment of his neighbours is wrong,
but his conﬁdence can’t often be strong enough to block his
neighbours’ judgment from making some impression upon
him. . . .

I should point out that •how much importance we at-
tach to the agreement or disagreement of other people’s
sentiments and judgments with our own is always exactly
proportional to •how unsure we are about the propriety of
our own sentiments and the accuracy of our own judgments.
A morally sensitive man may sometimes feel great uneasi-
ness at the thought that he may have yielded too much to a

certain passion—even an ‘honourable passion’, so to speak,
such as his indignation at an injury that he or a friend has
sustained. He is anxiously afraid that while meaning only
to act in a spirited and just way he may have been led by
an unduly intense emotion to do a real injury to some other
person who, though not innocent, may have been less guilty
than he at ﬁrst seemed to be. In this situation the opinion
of other people comes to have the utmost importance for
him. Their approval is the most healing ointment that can be
poured into his uneasy mind; their disapproval the bitterest
and most tormenting poison. When he is perfectly satisﬁed
with every part of his own conduct, the judgment of other
people is often of less importance to him.

There are some noble and beautiful (1) arts in which the
degree of excellence can be determined only by a certain
nicety of taste, the decisions of which seem always to be
somewhat uncertain. There are (2) others in which success
can be rigorously demonstrated or at least strongly argued
for. Among the candidates for excellence in those different
arts, a concern for public opinion is always much greater in
(1) than in (2).

[Smith elaborates this through a couple of book-pages.
He puts poetry into class (1), and reports cases in which ﬁne
poets have been crushed by public disapproval of their work.
Mathematics is assigned to class (2), because mathematical
results are so certain that there’s no room for wrong dissent.]
Sometimes the morals of those different classes of learned
men are somewhat affected by this great difference in how
they stand with relation to the public.

Because mathematicians and natural philosophers are
independent of public opinion, they aren’t much tempted
to form themselves into factions and cliques, whether for
the support of their own reputation or for lowering the
reputation of their rivals. They are nearly all men of the most

67

Smith on Moral Sentiments

Love of praise, dread of blame

likeable simplicity of manners, who live in good harmony
with one another, are the friends of one another’s reputation,
and don’t enter into intrigues in order to secure the public
applause. They are pleased when their works are approved
of, but not much vexed or angry when they are neglected.

It’s not always like that with poets, or with those who
pride themselves on what is called ﬁne writing. They are
apt to divide themselves into a sort of literary factions, with
each gang being. . . .the mortal enemy of the reputation of
every other, and employing all the mean arts of intrigue
and persuasion to get public opinion to side with the works
of its own members and against those of its enemies and
rivals.
[Smith gives examples from France and England,
remarking that ‘the likeable Mr Addison didn’t think it
unworthy of his gentle and modest character’ to take the
lead in a conspiracy ‘to keep down the rising reputation of
Mr Pope’. He contrasts this with the more selﬂess characters
and conduct of ‘mathematicians and natural philosophers’.]
It is natural that our uncertainty concerning our own
merit, and our concern to think favorably of it, should
combine to make us •want to know the opinion of other
people regarding it and •to be more than ordinarily elevated
when that opinion is favourable (and more than ordinarily
humiliated when it is unfavourable). [Smith goes on to say
that we shouldn’t be willing to plot and scheme to get the
favourable opinion or avoid the unfavourable one. Praise
that one gets by unfair means is deprived of what mature and
decent people regard as the main value of praise—namely its
value as evidence that one is praiseworthy. He continues:]

The man who performs a praiseworthy action may also
want the praise that is due to it—perhaps even more than is
due to it. The two motivations—·to be praiseworthy and to
be praised·—are in this case blended together. Even the man
himself may not know how far his conduct was inﬂuenced by

each of them, and it’s hardly ever possible for the rest of us
to know. [What we’ll say about that, Smith says, will depend
on how much we like the man in question and perhaps on
what general view we have of human nature. He’ll return
later to the topic of ‘splenetic’ views of human nature. Then:]
Very few men can be satisﬁed with their own private
sense that their qualities and conduct are of the kinds they
admire and think praiseworthy in other people, unless they
actually receive praise for those qualities and that conduct.
In this respect, though, men differ considerably from one
another. Some men when they are perfectly satisﬁed in
their own minds that they are praiseworthy seem not to care
whether they are praised; others seem to care much less
about praiseworthiness than about praise.

Unless a man avoids being actually blamed or reproached,
he can’t be completely sure—he can’t even be fairly sure—
that nothing in his conduct has been blameworthy. A wise
man may often neglect praise [i.e. not give any thought to whether
he is being praised], even when he has best deserved it; but
in any seriously important matter he will try hard to act
in such a way as to avoid not only •blameworthiness but
also—as much as possible—every •plausible imputation of
blame. . . . To show much concern about praise, even for
praiseworthy actions, is usually a mark not of great wisdom
but of some degree of weakness; whereas in a concern to
avoid the shadow of blame or reproach there may be no
weakness but the most praiseworthy prudence. . . .

The all-wise Author of Nature has in this way taught man
to respect the sentiments and judgments of his brethren—to
be more or less pleased when they approve of his conduct
and hurt when they disapprove of it. We could put this by
saying that God has appointed man to be the immediate
judge of mankind, this being one of the many respects in
which he has created man after his own image. . . . Each

68

Smith on Moral Sentiments

Love of praise, dread of blame

man is taught by nature to acknowledge the power and
jurisdiction that has thus been conferred on his fellow-men,
to be more or less humbled and humiliated when he has
drawn their censure, and to be more or less elated when he
has obtained their applause.

But although men have in this way been appointed as
the immediate judges of mankind, they are judges only in a
lower court. Any sentence that they pass, ·i.e. any sentence
of the man without·, can be appealed to a much higher
court, namely to the tribunal of

their own consciences, the supposed impartial and
well-informed spectator, the man within the breast,
the great judge and arbiter of their conduct.

The jurisdictions of those two tribunals are based on prin-
ciples that are in reality different and distinct, though in
some respects they are alike. . . . The jurisdiction of the man
without is wholly based on the desire for actual praise, and
aversion to actual blame. That of the man within is wholly
based on the desire for praiseworthiness and aversion to
blameworthiness, i.e.

the desire to have the qualities and perform the ac-
tions that we love and admire in other people, and the
fear of having the qualities and performing the actions
that we hate and despise in other people.

If the man without should applaud us for actions we haven’t
performed or motives that didn’t inﬂuence us, the man
within can immediately humble the pride and elation that
such groundless acclamations might otherwise cause, by
telling us that when we accept them we make ourselves
despicable because we know that we don’t deserve them.
And on the other side, if the man without should reproach
us for actions we haven’t performed or motives that didn’t in-
ﬂuence us, the man within can immediately correct this false
judgment and assure us that we are not proper objects of

the censure that has so unjustly been laid on us. But. . . .the
man within seems sometimes to be astonished and confused
by the noisy vigour of the man without. The violence and
loudness with which blame is sometimes poured out on us
seems to stupefy and numb our natural sense of praise-
worthiness and blameworthiness; and the judgments of the
man within, even if not absolutely altered or perverted, are so
much shaken in the steadiness and ﬁrmness of their decision
that they lose much of their natural effect of securing the
tranquillity of the mind. We hardly dare ﬁnd ourselves not
guilty when all our brethren appear to condemn us loudly.
The •supposed impartial spectator of our conduct seems
fearful and hesitating when he gives his opinion in our
favour, whereas all the •real spectators. . . .are unanimous
and violent in giving their judgment against us.
[Smith
calls the man within a ‘demigod’, partly mortal and partly
immortal and divine. He continues:] When the judgments of
the man within are steadily and ﬁrmly directed by the sense
of praiseworthiness and blameworthiness, he seems to act
suitably to his divine birth; but when he allows himself to
be astonished and confused by the judgments of ignorant
and weak man, he reveals his connection with mortality and
seems to act in line with the human rather than the divine
part of his origin.

When this happens, the only effective consolation for a
humbled and afﬂicted man lies in an appeal to a still higher
tribunal, namely that of the all-seeing Judge of the world,
whose eye can never be deceived and whose judgments can
never be perverted. Our man was supplied by nature with
the man within his breast, who was to act in this life as the
great guardian of his innocence and of his tranquillity; but
this man within has been disturbed and astonished ·by the
clamour of public disapproval·, so that our man’s mind has
become weak and despondent; and now the only support he

69

Smith on Moral Sentiments

Love of praise, dread of blame

can ﬁnd is in a ﬁrm conﬁdence in the unerring rightness of
the judgments of God’s tribunal, before which his innocence
will eventually be declared and his virtue rewarded. So our
happiness in this life often depends on the humble hope and
expectation of a life to come. This hope and expectation is
deeply rooted in human nature, which needs

•to support its lofty ideas of its own dignity,
•to brighten the dreary prospect of continually ap-
proaching •death, and
•to maintain its cheerfulness under all the heaviest
calamities to which the disorders of this life sometimes
expose it.

[Smith wrote ‘continually approaching •mortality’—obviously a slip.]
That there is a world to come, in which. . . .every man will
be ranked with those who really are his equals in moral and
intellectual qualities. . . .is a doctrine that is in every respect
so venerable, and so comfortable to the weakness of human
nature and so ﬂattering to its grandeur, that any virtuous
man who has the misfortune to doubt it can’t help earnestly
wishing to believe it. It wouldn’t have been exposed to the
derision of the scoffers if it weren’t for the fact that some of
its most zealous supporters have described the distribution
of rewards and punishments to be made in that world to
come in a way that has too often been in direct opposition to
all our moral sentiments.

A complaint that we have all heard from many a venerable

but discontented old ofﬁcer is that

•an assiduous courtier is often more favoured than a
faithful and active servant, that
•attending and applauding are often shorter and surer
roads to promotion than merit or service, and that
•a ‘campaign’ ·of hanging around as a courtier at the
court of· Versailles or St James’s is often worth two
·military· campaigns in Germany or Flanders.

But what is considered as the greatest reproach even to the
weakness of earthly sovereigns has been ascribed to divine
perfection as an act of justice! The duties of devotion—the
public and private worship of God—have been represented,
even by able and virtuous men, as the only virtues that can
either entitle us to reward or exempt us from punishment
in the life to come. . . . The philosophically inclined Bishop
Massillon, in a ceremony of blessing the ﬂags of a military
regiment of Catinat, said this to the ofﬁcers:

‘The most deplorable thing in your situation, gentle-
men, is that in a hard and painful life in which your
duties sometimes go beyond the rigour and severity
of the most austere cloisters, your sufferings won’t
help you in the life to come or—in many cases—in
this present life. Alas! the solitary monk in his cell,
obliged to mortify the ﬂesh [= ‘to semi-starve and inﬂict
physical pain on himself’] and to subject it to the spirit,
is supported by the hope of an assured reward and
by the secret support of the grace that softens the
yoke of the Lord. But can you on your death-bed
dare to represent to God the wearying daily hardships
of your employment? can you dare to ask him for
any reward?. . . . Alas! my brother, if one single day
of those sufferings were consecrated to the Lord, it
might have brought you eternal happiness. Offering
up to God one single action that was painful to nature
might have secured for you the inheritance of the
saints. And you have done all this, and in vain, for
this world!’

This comparison between •the futile mortiﬁcations of a
monastery and •the ennobling hardships and hazards of
war, this supposition that one day—one hour—employed in
•the former should in God’s eyes have more merit than a
whole life spent honourably in •the latter, is surely contrary

70

Smith on Moral Sentiments

Authority of conscience

to all our moral sentiments, contrary to all the principles
by which nature has taught us to regulate our contempt or
admiration. But this is the spirit that has

•reserved the Heavenly regions for monks and friars,
and for people whose conduct and conversation re-
sembled those of monks and friars,

while at the same time

•condemning to Hell all the heroes, all the statesmen
and lawgivers, all the poets and philosophers of for-
mer ages; all those who have invented, improved, or
excelled in the arts that contribute to the survival,
convenience, or ornament of human life; all the great
protectors, instructors, and benefactors of mankind;
all those to whom our natural sense of praiseworthi-
ness forces us to ascribe the highest merit and most
exalted virtue.

It’s no wonder that such a strange application of this most
respectworthy doctrine should sometimes have exposed it
to contempt and derision—at least from people who didn’t
themselves have any taste for or skill in the devout and
contemplative virtues.

Chapter 3:
conscience

The inﬂuences and authority of

The approval of a man’s own conscience is in some special
cases barely enough to content him; the testimony of the
supposed impartial spectator, that great inmate of the breast,
can’t always give him all the support he needs. Still, the
inﬂuence and authority of this principle [see note on page 164]
is always very great, and it’s only by consulting this inner
judge that we can ever see our own character and conduct
in its proper shape and dimensions, or make any proper
comparison between our own interests and other people’s.

We all know that to the eye of the body objects appear
great or small not so much according to their real sizes as
according to how far away they are. Well, the same is true for
what may be called the natural eye of the mind, and we
make up for the defects of both these ‘eyes’ in pretty much
the same way. From where I am now sitting, an immense
landscape of lawns, woods, and distant mountains seems
to have barely the width of the little window that I write
by. . . . My only way of soundly comparing those mountains
etc. with the little objects in my study is to transport myself
in imagination to a different viewpoint from which I can see
both at nearly equal distances. . . . Habit and experience have
taught me to do this so easily and smoothly that I am hardly
aware of doing it at all; and it takes some knowledge of optics
for a man to be thoroughly convinced of how small those
distant objects would appear to the eye if the imagination
didn’t, knowing what their real sizes are, puff them up.

In the same way, to the selﬁsh and basic passions of
human nature the loss or gain of a very small interest of our
own appears to be vastly more important than the greatest
concern of someone else with whom we have no particular
connection—arousing a more passionate joy or sorrow, a
more ardent desire or aversion. As long as the other person’s
interests are surveyed from this viewpoint, they can never
be put into the balance with our own, can never hold us
back from doing whatever favours our interests, however
ruinous to his. To make a proper comparison between
his interests and ours, we must change our position. We
must view both lots of interests not from our own place
or from his, and not with our own eyes or with his, but
from the place and with the eyes of a third person who has
no particular connection with either of us, and who judges
impartially between us. Here, too, habit and experience
have taught us to do this so easily and smoothly that we are

71

Smith on Moral Sentiments

Authority of conscience

hardly aware of doing it at all; and in this case too it takes
some reﬂection—and even some philosophy—for a man to
be convinced regarding how little interest he would take in
his neighbour’s greatest concerns. . . .if the sense of propriety
and justice didn’t correct the otherwise natural inequality of
our sentiments.

Let us suppose that the great and populous empire of
China was suddenly swallowed up by an earthquake, and
let us consider how a humane man in Europe—one with
no sort of connection with China—would be affected when
he heard about this dreadful calamity. I imagine that he
would ﬁrst strongly express his sorrow for the misfortune
of that unhappy people, and would make many melancholy
reﬂections on the precariousness of human life, and the
pointlessness of all the labours of man, which could thus
be annihilated in a moment. He might also, if he were
given to this sort of thing, think about how this disaster
might affect the commerce of Europe and the trade and
business of the world in general. [This was written 17 years before
the appearance of Smith’s The Wealth of Nations.] And when all this
ﬁne philosophy was over, and all these humane sentiments
had been expressed, he would go about his business or his
pleasure. . . .with the same ease and tranquillity as if no such
accident had happened. The most trivial ‘disaster’ that could
befall him would disturb him more. If he was due to lose his
little ﬁnger tomorrow, he wouldn’t sleep to-night; but he will
snore contentedly over the ruin of a hundred million of his
brethren, provided he never saw them; so the destruction of
that immense multitude seems clearly to be of less concern
to him than this paltry misfortune of his own. Well, then:

Would a humane man be willing to avoid this paltry
misfortune to himself—·this loss of a little ﬁnger·—
by sacriﬁcing the lives of a hundred million of his
brethren, provided he had never seen them?

Human nature jumps back with horror at the thought.
The world in its greatest depravity and corruption never
produced a villain who could think of behaving in such a
way. But what makes this difference? When our passive
feelings are almost always so sordid and selﬁsh, how does
it happen that our active drives are often so generous and
so noble? Given that we’re always so much more deeply
affected by whatever concerns ourselves than by whatever
concerns other people, what is it that prompts generous
people always (and mean people sometimes) to sacriﬁce their
own interests to the greater interests of others? It’s not •the
soft power of humaneness, •that feeble spark of benevolence
that Nature has kindled in the human heart, that is thus
capable of counteracting •the strongest impulses of self-love.
What comes into play in these cases is a stronger power, a
more forcible motive. It is reason, principle, conscience, the
inhabitant of the breast, the man within, the great judge
and arbiter of our conduct. It is he who, whenever we are
about to act in some way that will affect the happiness of
others, calls to us with a voice capable of astonishing the
most presumptuous of our passions! What he tells us is that
•we are only one of the multitude, in no respect better
than any other, and that
•when we prefer ourselves so shamefully and so blindly
to others we become proper objects of resentment,
abhorrence, and cursing.

It’s only from him that we learn the real littleness of our-
selves and of whatever relates to ourselves; and the natural
misrepresentations of self-love can be corrected only by the
eye of this impartial spectator. It is he who shows us

•the propriety of generosity and the ugliness of injus-
tice,
•the propriety of forgoing our own greatest interests in
favour of the still greater interests of others, and

72

Smith on Moral Sentiments

Authority of conscience

•the ugliness of doing the smallest injury to someone
else in order to get the greatest beneﬁt to ourselves.
It is not the love of our neighbour, the love of mankind, that
often prompts us to practice those divine virtues. What
usually comes into play on such occasions is a stronger love,
a more powerful affection—the love of what is honourable
and noble, of the grandeur and dignity and superiority of our
own characters.

When the happiness or misery of others depends in any
way on how we behave, we dare not follow self-love’s hint
and prefer the interest of one to that of many. ·If we start to
move in that direction·, the man within immediately tells us
•that we are valuing ourselves too much and other people
too little, and •that by doing this we make ourselves the
proper object of other people’s contempt and indignation.
And this sentiment isn’t conﬁned to men of extraordinary
magnanimity and virtue.
It is deeply impressed on every
reasonably good soldier, who feels that his companions would
despise him if they thought him capable of shrinking from
danger, or of hesitating to risk—or even to throw away—his
life when the good of the service required it.

If I could bring myself a large beneﬁt by doing you a
small harm, is it all right for me to prefer myself over you to
that extent? No! The poor man mustn’t defraud or steal
from the rich, even if the beneﬁt the acquisition would
bring him would be much larger than the harm it would
do to the rich man. ·If a poor man starts to plan such a
theft·, the man within immediately tells him that he is no
better than his neighbour, and that by this unjust preference
·for himself over the rich man· he makes himself a proper
object •of the contempt and indignation of mankind and •of
the punishment that their contempt and indignation will
naturally dispose them to inﬂict. Punishment? Yes!—for
having violated one of the sacred rules that must be mainly

observed if human society is to continue in security and
peace. Any ordinarily honest man will dread •the inward
disgrace of such an action, stamping an indelible stain on
his own mind, more than •the greatest external calamity that
could possibly befall him. . . .

When the happiness or misery of others in no way de-
pends on our conduct, when our interests are altogether
separated and detached from theirs so that there’s neither
connection nor competition between them, we don’t always
think it so necessary to restrain •our natural and perhaps
improper anxiety about our own affairs, or •our natural and
perhaps equally improper indifference about those of other
men. The most ordinary education teaches us to act on all
important occasions with some sort of impartiality between
ourselves and others, and even the ordinary commerce of
the world is capable of adjusting our active drives so that
they conform to some degree of propriety. But a highly
developed and reﬁned education has been said to be needed
to correct the inequalities of our passive feelings. For this
purpose, it has been claimed, we must resort to philosophical
investigations that are extremely severe and extremely deep.
Two different sets of philosophers have tried to teach us

this hardest of all the lessons of morality.

(1) Some have worked to increase our sensitivity to the
interests of others; they want us to feel for others as
we naturally feel for ourselves.

(2) The other group have worked to lessen our awareness
of our own interests; they want us to feel for ourselves
as we naturally feel for others.

It may be that both have carried their doctrines a good
distance beyond the just standard of nature and propriety.
(1) The ﬁrst group are the whining and melancholy moral-
ists who are perpetually reproaching us for being happy
when so many of our brethren are in misery, who regard

73

Smith on Moral Sentiments

Authority of conscience

as impious the natural joy of prosperity that doesn’t think
of the many wretches who are labouring under all sorts of
calamities—poverty, disease, horrors of death, the insults
and oppression of their enemies. In their opinion,

commiseration for miseries that we never saw and
never heard of, but that we can be sure are at all times
infesting large numbers of our fellow-creatures, ought
to damp the pleasures of people who are fortunate,
and to make a certain melancholy dejection habitual
to all men.

·There are three things wrong with this·.
•This extreme
sympathy with misfortunes that we know nothing about
seems altogether absurd and unreasonable. Taking the
world as a whole, for each man who suffers pain or misery
there are twenty in prosperity and joy, or at least in tolerable
circumstances. Surely no reason can be given why we should
weep with the one rather than rejoice with the twenty. •Also,
this artiﬁcial commiseration is not only absurd but seems
altogether impossible for us. Those who act as though this
was their frame of mind usually have nothing but a certain
artiﬁcial and sentimental sadness that makes their faces and
conversation irrelevantly dismal and disagreeable without
reaching their heart. •And, lastly, even if this disposition of
mind could be achieved it would be perfectly useless, serving
merely to make miserable the person who had it. . . . All
men, however distant, are no doubt entitled to our good
wishes, and our good wishes we naturally give them. But if
they should be unfortunate, it’s no part of our duty to give
ourselves any anxiety about that. . . .

(2) The moralists who try to correct the natural inequality
of our passive feelings by making us less sensitive to what
specially concerns ourselves include all the ancient sects of
philosophers and especially the ancient Stoics. According
to them a man ought to regard himself not as something

separated and detached but as a citizen of the world, a
member of the vast commonwealth of nature. He ought at
all times to be willing that his own little interests should be
sacriﬁced to the interests of this great community. Whatever
concerns him personally ought to affect him no more than
whatever concerns any other equally important part of this
immense system—·e.g. any other one person·. We should
view ourselves not in the light that our own selﬁsh passions
are apt to throw, but in the light in which any other citizen
of the world would view us. . . .

[Preparing the ground for discussing this, Smith distin-
guishes private misfortunes into (a) ones that affect us by
affecting our near and dear—parents, offspring, and so on;
and (b) ones that affect us immediately and directly. There is
a great variety of possible misfortunes of either kind—pain,
sickness, approaching death, poverty, disgrace, and so on.]
(a) In misfortunes of the ﬁrst kind our emotions may go
far beyond what exact propriety will accept, but they may
likewise fall short of that—and they often do. A man who
felt no more for the death or distress of his own father or
son than for the death or distress of someone else’s father or
son would strike us as being neither a good son nor a good
father. Such unnatural indifference, far from arousing our
applause, would draw our highest disapproval. But these
domestic affections ·fall into two groups for our present
purposes·: we are apt to have some of them more strongly
than is proper, and to have others less strongly than we
should. Nature in its wisdom has, in most and perhaps
all men, installed a much stronger drive towards •parental
tenderness than towards •ﬁlial respect. The continuance and
propagation of the species depend entirely on •the former,
and not at all on •the latter. The existence and survival
of the child usually depends altogether on the care of the
parents, whereas parents’ existence and survival seldom

74

Smith on Moral Sentiments

Authority of conscience

depend on the care of the child. That’s why Nature has
made the former affection so strong that it generally requires
not to be aroused but to be moderated. . . . But moralists
do urge us to an affectionate attention to our parents, and
to make a proper return to them in their old age for the
kindness that they showed us in our youth.
In the Ten
Commandments we are commanded to honour our fathers
and mothers; and nothing is said about our love for our
children, ·because· Nature had sufﬁciently prepared us for
the performance of this latter duty. Men are seldom accused
of pretending to be fonder of their children than they really
are, but they have sometimes been suspected of putting
too much show into their displays of piety towards their
parents. The ostentatious sorrow of widows has, for a like
reason, been suspected of insincerity. We would respect
even excessive affections [see note on page 116] of that kind if
we believed them to be sincere; and even if we didn’t perfectly
approve, we wouldn’t severely condemn either. . . .

Although the excess of affections of this sort appears to
be blameworthy, it never appears to be odious. We blame
a parent’s excessive fondness and concern as something
that may eventually be harmful to the child, and is in
the meantime excessively inconvenient to the parent; but
we easily pardon it and never regard it with hatred and
detestation. But when a parent has •too little of this parental
affection of which most parents have •too much, that always
strikes us as especially odious. The man who seems to feel
nothing for his own children, treating them on all occasions
with undeserved severity and harshness, seems the most
detestable of all brutes. Our sense of propriety, so far from
requiring us to eradicate altogether the special sensitivity
that we naturally have for the misfortunes of our near and
dear, is always much more offended by someone’s having too
little of that sensitivity than it ever is by someone’s having

too much. When it comes to feelings and attitudes towards
one’s parents, one’s offspring, and the like, the apathy
recommended by the Stoics is never agreeable, and all the
metaphysical trick-arguments by which it is supported can
seldom achieve anything except to work on a coxcomb [here =
‘moral idiot’], making his hard unfeelingness ten times worse
than it would have been if he had been left to himself. . . .

•That moderated sensitivity to the misfortunes of others,
which doesn’t disqualify us for the performance of any
duty; •the melancholy and affectionate remembrance of our
departed friends; what ·the poet· Gray calls •‘the pang, to
secret sorrow dear’, are by no means unpleasant sensations.
Though they outwardly wear the features of pain and grief,
they are all inwardly stamped with the ennobling characters
of virtue and self-approval.

(b) When it comes to the misfortunes that affect us
immediately and directly—in our body, our fortune, or our
reputation—the sense of propriety is much more apt to be
offended by someone’s having too much sensitivity to these
than by someone’s having too little of it. There are few cases
where we can come too near to the apathy and indifference
recommended by the Stoics.

[Smith now offers a couple of pages of remarks about how
our sympathy with others’ misfortunes varies in intensity,
in tone, and in resultant behaviour, depending on whether
the misfortune in question is bodily pain, ﬁnancial loss, or
loss of reputation. This material is book-ended between two
occurrences of the remark that although such sympathy is a
kind of sadness there is also something agreeable about it.
Then:]

If we examine the different shades and gradations of
weakness and self-control that we meet with in everyday life,
we’ll see that this control of our passive feelings must be
acquired not from •the abstruse syllogisms of a quibbling

75

Smith on Moral Sentiments

Authority of conscience

dialectic but from •the great discipline that Nature has
established as a means for acquiring this and every other
virtue, namely a regard for the sentiments of the real or
supposed spectator of our conduct.

A very young child has no self-control. Whether it is
suffering fear or grief or anger, it always does its best by the
violence of its outcries to alarm the attention of its nurse
or its parents. While it remains under the custody of such
•partial protectors [= ‘protectors who are biased in its favour’], its
anger is the ﬁrst and perhaps the only passion it is taught
to moderate.
In defence of their own peace of mind, the
protectors are often obliged to use noise and threatening of
their own to frighten the child into a good mood, and the
passion that incites it to attack is restrained by the passion
that teaches it to look to its own safety. When it is old
enough to go to school or to mix with its equals, the child
soon ﬁnds that they have no such indulgent •partiality. It
naturally wants to gain their favour and to avoid their hatred
or contempt—indeed, regard for its own safety teaches it
to do so—and it soon ﬁnds that the only way to do that is
to moderate not only its anger but all its other passions,
toning them down to a level that the child’s playmates and
companions are likely to be pleased with. It thus enters into
the great school of self-control, studies to be more and more
master of itself, and begins to discipline its own feelings—a
task that few people bring to completion in the course of a
lifetime!

[Smith now presents a long account of how someone
who is suffering conducts himself in relation to friends and
acquaintances, depending on whether the sufferer is (i) ‘the
weakest man’, (ii) ‘a man of a little more ﬁrmness’, or (iii)
a ‘man of real constancy and ﬁrmness’. The differences
are what you might expect. Notable in the account of (i)
is Smith’s remark that this weak man tries to get more

sympathy from others by upping his expressions of pain and
sorrow, behaving ‘like a child that has not yet gone to school’.
The man in (ii) does better: he stays calm, feels the approval
that his friends and acquaintances have for his restraint,
and is thus encouraged to keep it up, silently ‘applauding
himself’. There is much more about this, but it doesn’t add
signiﬁcantly to the philosophical content. Then there is the
man in (iii):]

[This paragraph down to * is almost exactly as Smith wrote it.] The
man of real constancy and ﬁrmness, the wise and just
man who has been thoroughly bred in the great school of
self-control, in the bustle and business of the world, exposed
perhaps to the violence and injustice of faction and to the
hardships and hazards of war, maintains this control of his
passive feelings on all occasions; and whether in solitude
or in society he wears nearly the same countenance and
is affected in nearly the same manner.
In success and
in disappointment, in prosperity and in adversity, before
friends and before enemies, he has often had to maintain
this manliness. He has never dared to forget for one moment
the judgment that the impartial spectator would pass on his
sentiments and conduct. He has never dared to allow •the
man within the breast to be absent from his attention for
one moment. He has always been accustomed to look at
anything relating to him with the eyes of •this great inmate.
This habit has become perfectly familiar to him.* What he
has constantly done and indeed constantly needed to do is
to model—or try to model—not only what he does and how
he does it, but even his inward sentiments and feelings on
those of •this awe-inspiring and respectworthy judge. [Here
and in a few other places, the phrase ‘what he does and how he does
it’ replaces Smith’s ‘his outward conduct and behaviour’.
It is a guess
about what he meant.] He doesn’t merely portray the sentiments
of the impartial spectator—he really adopts them. He almost

76

Smith on Moral Sentiments

Authority of conscience

identiﬁes himself with—he almost becomes—that impartial
spectator, and almost never feels anything that this great
judge of his conduct doesn’t direct him to feel.

[Then a paragraph in which Smith says that a man’s
approval of himself for doing A is proportional to how hard
it was for him to do A. He continues:] A man who has had
a leg shot off and who in the next moment speaks and
acts with his usual coolness and tranquillity shows a high
degree of self-control, so he naturally feels a high degree of
self-approval. With most men to whom this happened, their
own natural view of their misfortune would force itself on
them with such a vivacity and strength of colouring that
it would entirely wipe out all thought of any other way of
looking at it. They wouldn’t feel anything—couldn’t attend
to anything—except their own pain and fear; they would
entirely disregard not only the judgment of the ideal man
within the breast but also that of any real spectators who
happened to be present.

Given that a man behaves well in face of misfortune,
how well he counts as behaving depends on how great the
misfortune is; and Nature’s reward for good behaviour under
misfortune is exactly proportioned to how good the behaviour
is. The more self-control that is needed for us to conquer our
natural sensibility—·which includes our natural inclination
to whine and complain·—the greater are our pleasure and
pride in achieving the conquest. And this pleasure and
pride ·over having won a moral victory· are so great that
no-one who has them can be altogether unhappy. Misery
and wretchedness can’t enter the breast in which complete
self-satisfaction dwells. The Stoics say that a wise man who
has his leg shot off will be as happy as he would have been
if this hadn’t happened; that may be going too far, but we
do have to agree that the man’s complete enjoyment of his
own self-applause will greatly alleviate •his sense of his own

sufferings, even if it doesn’t altogether extinguish •it.

In such paroxysms of distress, ·even· the wisest and
ﬁrmest man presumably won’t be able to stay calm without a
considerable and even a painful exertion. He is hard-pressed
by his natural feeling of his own distress, (1) his natural
view of his own situation, and will need a great effort to ﬁx
his attention on (2) the view that the impartial spectator
has of his situation. Both views present themselves to
him at the same time. His sense of honour, his regard
for his own dignity, directs him to ﬁx his whole attention on
(2), while his natural—untaught and undisciplined—feelings
are continually calling it away to (1). On this occasion he
doesn’t perfectly identify himself with the ideal man within
the breast; he doesn’t himself become the impartial spectator
of his own conduct. The two views both exist in his mind sep-
arate and distinct from one another, directing his behaviour
in different directions. When he follows (2) the view that
honour and dignity point out to him, •Nature gives him some
reward—the enjoyment of his own complete self-approval
and of the applause of every honest and impartial spectator.
But this isn’t enough to compensate completely for the real
sufferings that he undergoes through Nature’s unalterable
If it did completely
laws.
make up for them, his self-interest would give him no motive
for avoiding such events as the loss of a leg, which would
lessen his utility both to himself and to society. . . .) So he
does suffer.
In the agony of the paroxysm he maintains
the manhood of his countenance and the steadiness of his
judgment, but it requires his utmost and most fatiguing
exertions to do so.

(And it’s good that it doesn’t!

By the constitution of human nature, however, agony can
never be permanent; and if our man survives the paroxysm
he soon arrives at an easy enjoyment of his ordinary tran-
quillity. There’s no doubt that a man with a wooden leg is

77

Smith on Moral Sentiments

Authority of conscience

burdened with a considerable inconvenience, and foresees
that he’ll have this for the rest of his life. But he soon
comes to view it in exactly the way every impartial spectator
views it—as an inconvenience under which he can enjoy all
the ordinary pleasures both of solitude and of society. He
soon identiﬁes himself with the ideal man within the breast,
becoming himself the impartial spectator of his own situation.
He no longer weeps, laments, or grieves over it as a weak
man might do in the beginning. The view of the impartial
spectator becomes so perfectly habitual to him that without
putting any effort or exertion into this he never thinks of
surveying his misfortune in any other way.

The never-failing certainty with which all men eventually
adjust themselves to ﬁt whatever becomes their permanent
situation may lead us to think that the Stoics were nearly
right, to this extent:

Between one permanent situation and another there
is, with regard to real happiness, no essential differ-
ence. Or if there is, it’s a difference that sufﬁces •to
support a preference for some of them, but only a
simple preference, not an earnest or anxious desire;
and •to support a simple rejection of others, but not
an earnest or anxious aversion.

Happiness consists in tranquillity and enjoyment. Without
tranquillity there can be no enjoyment; and where there is
perfect tranquillity almost anything can be amusing. But in
every permanent situation where there’s no expectation of
change, the mind of every man returns, sooner or later, to
its natural and usual state of tranquillity. In prosperity it
eventually falls back to that state; in adversity it eventually
rises up to it. . . .

The great source of the misery and the disorders of human
life seems to be men’s over-rating of the difference between
one permanent situation and another—the over-rating

—by avarice of the difference between poverty and riches,
—by ambition of the difference between a private and a

public station,

—by vain-glory of the difference between obscurity and

extensive reputation.

Someone under the inﬂuence of any of those extravagant
passions is not only miserable in his actual situation but
is often disposed to disturb the peace of society in order to
arrive at whatever it is that he so foolishly admires. [Smith
now embarks on a rather preachy page and a half of reasons
why behaviour in the service of any one of those ambitions is
almost certain to be pointless—too much chance of failure,
and too little chance of real satisfaction if one does succeed.
Then:]

It may seem •strange but I think it is •true that in the
misfortunes that can be somewhat remedied most men don’t
recover their natural and usual tranquillity as readily as
they do in misfortunes that clearly can’t be remedied. With
misfortunes of the latter kind, ·i.e. irremediable ones·, the
wise man’s sentiments and behaviour don’t differ noticeably
from those of the weak man except in what may be called
‘the paroxysm’, the ﬁrst attack. In the end, Time, the great
and universal comforter, gradually soothes the weak man
till he reaches the degree of tranquillity that the wise man,
having a concern for his own dignity and manhood, assumes
at the beginning. The case of the man with the wooden leg is
an obvious example of this. In the irreparable misfortunes
occasioned by the death of children, or of friends and rela-
tives, even a wise man may for a while permit himself some
moderate degree sorrow. An affectionate but weak woman
is often on such occasions almost perfectly distracted; but
Time eventually calms even her down. . . .

Our sensitivity to the feelings of others, far from being
inconsistent with •the manliness of self-control, is the very

78

Smith on Moral Sentiments

Authority of conscience

source of •it. The very same drive or instinct that •prompts
us to compassion for our neighbour’s sorrow in his the mis-
fortune also •prompts us in our own misfortune to restrain
the abject and miserable lamentations of our own sorrow.
The same drive or instinct that •prompts us to rejoice in
our neighbour’s joy over his prosperity and success also
•prompts us to restrain the rowdy light-heartedness of our
own joy. In both cases, the propriety of our own sentiments
and feelings seems to be exactly in proportion to the liveliness
and force with which we enter into and come to have his
sentiments and feelings.

[Smith now embarks on two not very interesting book-

pages presenting two theses about the relation between

(1) the ‘gentle virtue’ of sensitivity to the feelings of others

in their misfortunes, and

(2) the ‘great and awe-inspiring virtue’ of self-control and
moderation in the expression of one’s own feelings in
one’s own misfortunes.

[He states the theses as though they held also for the versions of (1) and
(2) that concern joy in good fortune; but his reason for the second of
them is conﬁned to (1) and (2) as stated above.] One thesis is that
‘the person best ﬁtted by nature for acquiring (1) is also best
ﬁtted for acquiring (2)’. The second thesis is that we don’t
often encounter anyone who has both of these virtues, for
a reason that Smith gives. Each of those virtues, he says,
requires not merely •natural ﬁtness but also practice, and
a life in which a man has plenty of opportunity to exercise
(2) is an arduous rough-and-tumble affair, full of hardships
and reverses, in which (1) is apt to be shouldered aside. He
continues:] Hardships, dangers, injuries, misfortunes are
the only masters under whom we can learn the exercise of
(2) this virtue. But these are all masters to whom no-one
willingly puts himself to school! [Smith develops this topic at
some length, and then switches to a new train of thought:]

In solitude we’re apt to feel too strongly anything relating

to ourselves; we are apt to

•over-rate the help we have given to others, to
•over-rate injuries we have suffered, to
•be too much elated by our own good fortune, and to
•be too much dejected by our own bad fortune.

The conversation of a friend brings us into a better frame
of mind, and the conversation of a stranger does this even
more. The man within the breast, the abstract and ideal
spectator of our sentiments and conduct, often needs to be
awakened and reminded of his duty by the presence of a real
spectator; and the spectator from whom we can expect the
least sympathy and indulgence is likely to be the one who
can give us the most complete lesson in self-control.

Are you in adversity? Don’t mourn in the darkness
of solitude, don’t regulate your sorrow according to the
indulgent sympathy of your intimate friends; as soon as
you can, get out into the day-light of the world and of society.
Live with strangers who don’t know or don’t care about your
misfortune. . . .

Are you in prosperity? Don’t conﬁne the enjoyment of
your good fortune to your own household, to the company
of your own friends and (perhaps) of your ﬂatterers, of the
company of people who hope to mend their fortunes by build-
ing on yours; spend time with people who are independent
of you, and value you only for your character and conduct
rather than for your fortune. . . .

The propriety of our moral sentiments is never so apt to
be corrupted as when an indulgent and partial spectator is
right here while the nearest unbiased and impartial one is a
long way off.

The only unbiased and impartial spectators of the conduct
of independent nations towards one another are neutral
nations. But they are so far away as to be almost out of

79

Smith on Moral Sentiments

Self-deceit, general rules

sight. When two nations are at odds with one another, a
citizen in either of them pays little regard to the sentiments
that foreign nations may have regarding his conduct. All he
wants is to have the approval of his fellow-citizens; and as
they are all driven by the same hostile passions that drive
him, his best way of pleasing them is to enrage and offend
their enemies. So the partial spectator is here, the impartial
one far away. That is why in war and negotiation the laws of
justice are seldom observed: truth and fair dealing are almost
totally disregarded; treaties are violated; and if a violation
brings some advantage, it brings almost no dishonour on the
violator. . . . In war, not only are the so-called ‘laws of nations’
often violated. . . .but most of those ‘laws’ themselves are laid
down with little regard for the plainest and most obvious
rules of justice. One of the plainest and most obvious rules
of justice is this:

Innocent people should not suffer or be punished be-
cause they are somehow connected with or dependent
on the guilty (a connection that they may be unable
to avoid).

Yet in the most unjust war it is often only the sovereign
or the rulers who are guilty, their subjects being perfectly
innocent. Whenever it suits the convenience of a public
enemy, however, the goods of the peaceable citizens are
seized, their lands laid waste, their houses burnt, and they
themselves, if they dare to resist, are murdered or led into
captivity—all this in perfect conformity with the ‘laws of
nations’!

[Smith goes on to say that the moral level of conﬂicts
between ‘hostile factions’ within a nation is even lower than
the moral level of wars between nations. No-one doubts that
in wars between nations one ought to ‘keep faith’ with the
enemy nation, i.e. keep promises given to it, keep contracts
made with it, and so on. Whereas when factions are at

war people seriously discuss whether faith ought to be kept
with rebels, or with heretics. Smith remarks acidly that
‘rebels and heretics are unlucky people who, when things
have reached a certain level of violence, have the misfortune
to belong to the weaker party’. He continues:] In a nation
distracted by faction there are always a few, but only a
few, who preserve their judgment untainted by the general
contagion. Such people have no inﬂuence on the course of
events, because the parties to the conﬂict won’t listen to
them. . . . All such people are held in contempt and derision,
often in detestation, by the furious zealots of both parties.
A true party-man hates and despises fair-mindedness, and
the fact is that no •vice could disqualify him for the trade
of a party-man as effectually as that single •virtue, fair-
mindedness, would. Thus, the real, revered, and impartial
spectator is never further off than amidst the violence and
rage of contending parties. To them, it may be said, such a
spectator hardly exists anywhere in the universe. Even to
the great Judge of the universe they attribute all their own
prejudices, and often view that Divine Being as driven by
all their own vindictive and implacable passions. Of all the
corrupters of moral sentiments, faction and fanaticism have
always been by far the greatest.

[In a ﬁnal pair of paragraphs Smith returns to the topic
of self-control in adversity, not adding much to what he has
already said.]

Chapter 4: The nature of self-deceit, and the origin
and use of general rules

To pervert our own judgments about the propriety of our
own conduct, it isn’t always necessary for the real impartial
spectator to be at a great distance. Even when he is present,
the violence and injustice of our own selﬁsh passions are

80

Smith on Moral Sentiments

Self-deceit, general rules

sometimes sufﬁcient to induce the man within the breast to
make a report very different from what the facts of the case
would authorise.

When do we examine our own conduct and try to see it
in the light in which the impartial spectator would see it?
(1) When we are about to act. (2) After we have acted. Our
views are apt to be biased in both cases; but they are apt
to be most biased when it is of most importance that they
should be balanced and fair.

(1) When we are about to act, the eagerness of passion
seldom allows us to consider what we are doing with the
fair-mindedness of an unbiased person. The violent emotions
that are agitating us then serve to discolour our views of
things, even when we are trying to place ourselves in the
situation of the impartial spectator and to see objects that
concern us in the light in which they will naturally appear to
him. The fury of our own passions constantly calls us back to
our own viewpoint, from which everything appears magniﬁed
and misrepresented by self-love. As for how those objects
would appear to someone else, the view that he would have
of them, we get only ﬂickering little glimpses that vanish in
a moment—and aren’t entirely right even while they last!
We can’t even for that moment rid ourselves of all the heat
and eagerness with which our particular situation inspires
us, or consider what we are about to do with the complete
impartiality of a fair-minded judge. As Malebranche says,
•the passions all seem reasonable and proportioned to their
objects for as long as we continue to feel •them.

(2) When the action is over and the passions that
prompted it have subsided, we can enter more coolly into
the sentiments of •the unbiased spectator. What concerned
us before ·we acted· now matters to us almost as little as
it always did to •him, and we can now examine our own
conduct as honestly and impartially as he does. The man

of today is no longer agitated by the same passions that
distracted the man of yesterday; and when the •paroxysm
of emotion is thoroughly over, we can identify ourselves
with the ideal man within the breast, and look at our own
•conduct with the severe eyes of the most impartial spectator.
(This echoes what I said earlier [page 77] about how, when the
•paroxysm of distress is over, we can look objectively and
impartially at our own •situation.) But now that the action
is over, our judgments are often nothing like as important
as they were before; they can often produce nothing but
pointless regret and useless repentance, without always
securing us from similar errors in future. And even in
this after-the-action situation, our judgments on our own
conduct are seldom entirely fair-minded. ·That is because·
our opinion of our own •character depends entirely on our
judgments regarding our past •conduct. It is so disagreeable
to think ill of ourselves that we often deliberately avert our
eyes from facts that might make that judgment unfavourable.
He is a bold surgeon (they say) whose hand doesn’t tremble
when he operates on himself; and it’s an equally bold person
who doesn’t hesitate to pull off the veil of self-delusion that
hides from his view the ugly parts of his own conduct [see note
on ‘ugly’ on page 8]. Rather than having such a disagreeable
view of our own behaviour, we too often—foolishly and
weakly—try to revive the unjust passions that had misled
us; we work to awaken our old hatreds and stir up again our
almost forgotten resentments; we even act on them again,
persevering in injustice merely because we were once unjust
and are ashamed and afraid to see that we were so.

That is how biased men’s views are regarding the pro-
priety of their own conduct, both at the time of action and
after it, and how hard it is for them to see it in the light in
which any impartial spectator would see it. ·The most basic
question of moral epistemology comes into play here·. Some

81

Smith on Moral Sentiments

Self-deceit, general rules

theorists hold that men judge their own conduct through a
special faculty, a ‘moral sense’, a special power of ·moral·
perception that picks out the beauty or ugliness of passions
and affections. But if that were right, men’s own passions
would be more immediately exposed to the view of •this
faculty, and •it would judge them with more accuracy than it
judged the passions of other men, which •it could view only
from a distance.

This self-deceit, this fatal weakness of mankind, is the
source of half the disorders of human life. If we saw ourselves
in the light in which others see us, or in which they would
see us if they knew all the facts, we couldn’t endure the sight
unless we immediately set about reforming ourselves.

But Nature hasn’t left us with absolutely no remedy for
this important weakness—she hasn’t abandoned us entirely
to the delusions of self-love. Our continual observations of
the conduct of others lead us unconsciously to construct
general rules about what is ﬁt and proper to do or to avoid.
Some of their actions shock all our natural sentiments. We
hear everyone around expressing the same detestation of
them, which conﬁrms and even increases our natural sense
of the actions’ ugliness. We’re satisﬁed that we are viewing
them in the proper light when we see other people viewing
them in the same light. We resolve never to be guilty of such
actions, and never to do anything that would in this way
make us objects of universal disapproval. In this natural way
we lay down for ourselves a general rule that all such actions
are to be avoided because they tend to make us odious,
contemptible, or punishable—i.e. objects of the sentiments
for which we have the greatest dread and aversion. On the
other side, other actions call forth our approval, and we hear
everyone around us express the same favourable opinion
about them. Everyone is eager to honour and reward them;
they arouse all the sentiments for which we have by nature

the strongest desire—the love, the gratitude, the admiration
of mankind. We come to want to act in those ways, and thus
naturally lay down for ourselves a rule of another kind, that
we should always be on the watch for opportunities to act in
this way.

That is how the general rules of morality are formed.
They are ultimately based on experience of what our moral
faculties—our natural sense of merit and propriety—approve
or disapprove of in particular instances. What happens is
not this:

(a) When we approve (or condemn) particular actions,
that is always because on examination those actions
appear to be agreeable to (or inconsistent with) a
certain general rule.

The real order is the opposite of that, namely:

(b) We ﬁnd from experience that all actions of a certain
kind. . . .are approved of or disapproved of, and on that
basis we form a general rule against all such actions.
·As an aid to seeing how wrong and unreal (a) is, as a general
account of how our particular moral judgments relate to our
general moral rules, suppose the following·:

You see an inhuman murder, committed out of greed,
envy, or misplaced resentment. The victim is someone
who had loved and trusted the murderer. You saw the
last agonies of the dying person, and heard him with
his expiring breath complain more of the treachery
and ingratitude of his false friend than of the violence
that had been done to him.

To arrive at a moral judgment on this horrible action you
won’t apply to it a general rule prohibiting the killing of
innocent people! Obviously you would arrive instantaneously
at your detestation of this crime, before you get to any
thought about a general rule that might apply to it. If you
do eventually form such a general rule, it will be based on

82

Smith on Moral Sentiments

Self-deceit, general rules

the detestation that you felt unstoppably arising in your own
breast at the thought of this action and any other of the
same kind.

[Smith now offers two paragraphs repeating and faintly

illustrating what he has just said. Then:]

Once these general rules have been formed, once they
are universally accepted and established by the concurring
sentiments of mankind, we often appeal to them as to
standards of judgment when we are debating the degree
of praise or blame that is appropriate for certain actions of
a complicated and dubious nature. On these occasions the
rules are commonly cited as the ultimate foundations of what
is just and unjust in human conduct; and this fact seems
to have misled several eminent authors into constructing
systems that seem to presuppose that mankind’s basic moral
judgments were formed in the way a law-court reaches its
decisions, namely by •ﬁrst considering the general rule and
•then deciding whether the particular action in question
comes within its scope.

When someone is wondering what it is ﬁt and proper for
him to do at a particular moment, his self-love may give
him a wrong answer; and in this situation he can be greatly
helped by general rules of conduct that have been ﬁxed in
his mind by habitual reﬂection. A man who is furiously
resentful of what someone has done to him might, if he
listened to the dictates of his resentment, regard his enemy’s
death as a small compensation for •the wrong he thinks has
been done to him—though it may in fact be merely •a slight
provocation. But what he has seen of the conduct of others
has taught him how horrible all such bloody revenges appear
·to people in general·. Unless he has been brought up in a
very strange way, he has imposed on himself an inviolable
rule telling him never to act in that way. This rule preserves
its authority over him, making him incapable of being guilty

of such a violent act.
If this had been the ﬁrst time he
ever considered such an action, the fury of his resentment
might have led him to think that killing his enemy was quite
just and proper, something that every impartial spectator
would approve of. But his reverence for the rule that past
experience has impressed on him holds back the onward
rush of his passion. . . . If he does allow himself to be carried
by his passion to the point where he will violate this rule,
he still can’t entirely throw off the awe and respect with
which he has been accustomed to regard it. At the very time
of acting, at the moment when passion reaches it highest
pitch, he hesitates and trembles at the thought of what he
is about to do; he is secretly aware that he is breaking a
rule which in all his cool hours he has resolved never to
break, which he has never seen broken by others without
the highest disapproval ·from himself and from people in
general·, and the breaking of which will (he expects) soon
render him an object of the same disagreeable sentiments.
Before he can make the last fatal decision, he is tormented
with all the agonies of doubt and uncertainty, terriﬁed at
the thought of violating such a sacred rule, and at the same
time urged to violate it by the fury of his desires. He keeps
wavering. Sometimes he resolves to keep to his principle,
and not give way to a passion that could spoil the rest of
his life with the horrors of shame and repentance; and then
a momentary calm takes possession of his breast. . . . But
immediately the passion arises anew and with fresh fury
drives him on to perform the action that he had a moment
ago resolved to abstain from. Wearied and distracted by
this continual indecision, he ﬁnally takes the last fatal and
irrecoverable step of killing his enemy, doing this from a
sort of despair; but doing it with the kind of terror and
bewilderment experienced by someone who, ﬂying from an
enemy, throws himself over a precipice—thus making his

83

Smith on Moral Sentiments

General rules of morality

destruction more certain than it would be if he had only his
enemy to reckon with. Such are his sentiments even at the
time of acting;. . . .and then later, when his passion has been
gratiﬁed and has calmed down, he begins to see what he
has done in the light in which others are apt to see it; and
he feels the stings of remorse and repentance beginning to
agitate and torment him.

Chapter 5: The inﬂuence and authority of the
general rules of morality, and why they are rightly
regarded as the laws of the Deity

A person’s regard for those general rules of conduct is
his sense of duty, a driver [Smith writes ‘principle’; see note on
page 164] of the greatest importance in human life, and the
only driver that most people have to direct their actions.
Many men behave decently, and don’t do anything very
wrong all through their lives, yet base their conduct only
on a regard for what they see to be the established rules
of behaviour. (That means that when we approve of their
conduct on the grounds that ‘The sentiment that led him to
act was a proper one’, we’re relying on sentiments that such
a person never has!) Here is an example:

A man has received great beneﬁts from someone else,
but because of the natural coldness of his tempera-
ment he feels only a small degree of the sentiment of
gratitude. But he has been virtuously educated, so
that he’ll often have been made to notice how odious
ungrateful actions appear and how likeable grateful
ones. So, although his heart is not warmed with any
grateful affection, he will make an effort to act as
if it were, and will try to pay to his benefactor all
the regards and attentions that the liveliest gratitude
could suggest.

[Smith details some of the actions this might involves. Then:]
He can do all this without any hypocrisy or blameworthy
deceit, without any selﬁsh intention of obtaining new favours,
and without any wish to impose on his benefactor or on the
public. It may be that these grateful-seeming actions of his
arise purely from •his reverence for the established rule of
duty, •his serious and earnest wish to behave strictly in
accordance with the law of gratitude. And again:

A wife doesn’t always feel •the tender regard for her
husband that is suitable to their married state. But
she has been virtuously educated, and will try to act
as if she did feel •it—to be careful, dutiful, faithful, and
sincere, and not to fall short in any of the attentions
that the sentiment of conjugal affection would (if she
had it) prompt her to perform.

Neither of these people—the friend and the wife—is the
best of his or her kind. Both of them have the most se-
rious and earnest desire to fulﬁll every part of their duty,
but they will fail in many subtle details of conduct, miss
many opportunities of obliging, which they wouldn’t have
overlooked if they had had the sentiment that is proper to
their situation. Still, without being the very best of their
kinds they are perhaps second-best; and if respect for the
general rules of conduct has been strongly impressed on
them, neither of them will fail in any essential part of their
duty. Only people with perfect characters can adjust their
sentiments and behaviour so that they stay exactly in tune
with the smallest differences in their situation, acting on all
occasions with the most delicate and accurate propriety. The
coarse clay of which most of us are made can’t be brought
to such perfection. But almost any man can, by discipline,
education, and example, be so impressed with a respect for
general rules that he will act on almost every occasion with
tolerable decency, and through the whole of his life avoid

84

Smith on Moral Sentiments

General rules of morality

doing anything considerably blameworthy.

Without •this sacred regard for general rules, no-one’s
conduct can be much depended on. •It is what constitutes
the most essential difference between a man of principle
and honour and a worthless fellow. The man of principle
keeps steadily and resolutely to his maxims on all occasions,
preserving through the whole of his life one even tenor of
conduct. [Smith uses ‘tenor’ several times, in a sense that the word still
has though it isn’t now much employed. The ‘tenor’ of someone’s conduct
is its general style or feel or tone or over-all shape.] The worthless
fellow acts variously and accidentally, depending on whether
mood, inclination, or self-interest happens to be uppermost.
Indeed, men are subject to such variations of mood that
without this respect for general rules a man who in all
his cool hours was delicately sensitive to the propriety of
conduct might often be led to act absurdly on the most
trivial occasions, ones in which it was hardly possible to
think of any serious motive he could have for behaving in
this manner. Your friend visits you when you happen to be
in a mood that makes it disagreeable to receive him; in your
present mood his civility is apt to appear an impertinent
intrusion; and if you gave way to that way of viewing things
you would behave toward him with coldness and lack of
interest. What makes you incapable of such rudeness is just
your respect for the general rules of civility and hospitality,
which prohibit it. . . . Now consider: if without regard to these
general rules

even the duties of politeness, which are so easily
observed and which one can hardly have any serious
motive to violate,

would often be violated, what would become of

the duties of justice, truth, chastity, ﬁdelity, which
are often hard to observe, and which there can be
many strong motives to violate?

A reasonable level of observance of these latter duties is
required for the very existence of human society, which
would crumble into nothing if mankind were not generally
impressed with a reverence for those important rules of
conduct.

This reverence is still further enhanced by the belief—ﬁrst
impressed by nature, later conﬁrmed by reasoning and
philosophy—that those important rules of morality are the
commands and laws of the Deity, who will eventually reward
those who obey them and punish those who don’t.

Imprinted by nature: Men are naturally led to ascribe all
their own sentiments and passions to whatever mysterious
beings happen to be the objects of religious fear in their
country. They attribute their own sentiments and passions
to the gods because they can’t conceive of any others. The
unknown intelligences that they imagine but don’t see must
have some sort of resemblance to intelligences of which they
have experience. During the ignorance and darkness of
pagan superstition, mankind seem to have formed the ideas
of their divinities so crudely that they ascribed to them, indis-
criminately, all the passions of human nature, including the
ones that do the least honour to our species—lust, hunger,
greed, envy, revenge. So they were bound also to attribute to
those beings (for whose excellence they still had the highest
admiration) the sentiments and qualities that are the great
ornaments of humanity, seeming to raise it to a resemblance
of divine perfection—the love of virtue and beneﬁcence, and
the hatred of vice and injustice. A man who was harmed by
someone else called on Jupiter to be witness of the wrong
that had been done to him, and he couldn’t doubt that
Jupiter would behold it with the same indignation that ﬁlls
·even· the meanest human being who sees injustice being
committed. The man who had harmed him felt himself to be a
proper object of the detestation and resentment of mankind;

85

Smith on Moral Sentiments

General rules of morality

and his natural fears led him to impute the same sentiments
to those awe-inspiring ·divine· beings whose presence he
couldn’t avoid and whose power he couldn’t resist. These
natural hopes and fears and suspicions were propagated by
sympathy, and conﬁrmed by education; and the gods were
universally represented as, and believed to be, the rewarders
of humaneness and mercy and the avengers of treachery
and injustice. And so it came about that religion, even in
its crudest form, gave support to the rules of morality long
before the age of disciplined reasoning and philosophy. It
was important for the happiness of mankind that the terrors
of religion should in this way enforce the natural sense
of duty—too important for nature to let it depend on the
slowness and uncertainty of philosophical researches.

Conﬁrmed by reasoning and philosophy: When these
researches did take place, they conﬁrmed the basic work
that nature had done. Whatever we believe about the basis
for our moral faculties—•certain work by reason, •a basic
instinct called a ‘moral sense’ or •some other source in our
nature—it can’t be doubted that those faculties were given
to us for the direction of our conduct in this life. They
bring with them the most obvious badges of this authority,
signifying that they were set up within us •to be the supreme
deciders in all our actions, •to superintend all our senses,
passions, and appetites, and •to judge how far each of them
should be indulged or restrained. Some writers have claimed
that our moral faculties are in this respect on a level with
the other faculties and appetites of our nature, having no
more right to restrain these others than the others have to
restrain them; but this is completely wrong. No other faculty
or source of action passes judgment on any other. Love
doesn’t judge regarding resentment, nor does resentment
judge regarding love. Those two passions may be opposite
to one another, but can’t properly be said to ‘approve’ or

‘disapprove’ of one another. Whereas the moral faculties
which are my present topic have as their special role the
bestowing of censure or applause on all the other drives in
our nature. They may be considered as a sort of sense, of
which those drives are the objects. Every sense is supreme
over its own objects. There is no appeal from the eye with
regard to the beauty of colours, or from the ear with regard to
the harmony of sounds, or from the sense of taste with regard
to the agreeableness of ﬂavours. Each of those senses is the
ﬁnal judge of its own objects. Whatever gratiﬁes the sense of
taste is sweet, whatever pleases the eye is beautiful, whatever
soothes the ear is harmonious. The very essence of each of
those qualities consists in its ﬁtness to please the sense to
which it is addressed. Well, the role of our moral faculties is,
in the same way, to decide when the ear ought to be soothed,
when the eye ought to be indulged, when the sense of taste
ought to be gratiﬁed, when and to what extent any other drive
in our nature ought to be indulged or restrained. Whatever is
agreeable to our moral faculties is ﬁt, right, and proper to be
done; whatever is disagreeable to them is wrong, unﬁt, and
improper. The sentiments that they approve of are graceful
and appropriate, the ones they disapprove of are ungraceful
and inappropriate. The whole meaning of the words ‘right’,
‘wrong’, ‘ﬁt’, ‘improper’, ‘graceful’, ‘inappropriate’ etc. has to
do only with what pleases or displeases those faculties.

Since these faculties were plainly intended to be the gov-
erning drives in human nature, the rules that they prescribe
should be regarded as the commands and laws of the Deity,
passed on to us by the deputies that he has set up within us.
All general rules are commonly called ‘laws’—e.g. the general
rules that bodies conform to in collisions are called the
‘laws of motion’. But the label ‘laws’ is much more suitable
for the general rules that our moral faculties conform to
in approving or condemning sentiments or actions. Those

86

Smith on Moral Sentiments

General rules of morality

rules are much more like laws properly so called, namely
the general rules that a sovereign lays down to direct the
conduct of his subjects. Like them, moral rules

•are rules to direct the free actions of men,
•are prescribed most surely by a lawful superior, and
•are associated with rewards and punishments.

[The middle one of those three is exactly as Smith wrote it.] God’s
deputies within us always punish any violation of the rules
that our moral faculties lay down, by the torments of inward
shame and self-condemnation; and they always reward obedi-
ence with tranquillity of mind, contentment, self-satisfaction.
There are countless other considerations that conﬁrm

this conclusion. ·Here is a two-premise argument for it·:

•The happiness of mankind and of all other rational
creatures seems to have been the original purpose
of the Author of nature when he brought them into
existence.

No other end seems worthy of the supreme wisdom and
divine benevolence that we necessarily ascribe to him; and
this opinion that we are led to by abstract thought about his
inﬁnite perfections is further conﬁrmed when we consider the
works of nature, which all seem to be intended to promote
happiness and guard against misery.

•In acting according to the dictates of our moral
faculties, we necessarily pursue the most efﬁcient
means for promoting the happiness of mankind.

Therefore:

•When we act in accordance with the dictates of our
moral faculties, we are in a sense co-operating with
the Deity and advancing as far as we can the plan of
Providence.

And, by a comparable argument, when we defy the dictates
of our moral faculties we seem to obstruct somewhat the
scheme that the Author of nature has established for the

happiness and perfection of the world, and to declare our-
selves to be in some measure the enemies of God. So we are
naturally encouraged to hope for his extraordinary favour
and reward in the one case, and to fear his vengeance and
punishment in the other.

There are many other reasons. . . .tending to conﬁrm and
teach the same salutary doctrine. Consider the general rules
by which external prosperity and adversity are commonly
distributed in this life.
If you do, you’ll ﬁnd—despite the
disorder that everything seems to be in—that even here in
this world every virtue naturally gets its proper reward, the
one that is most ﬁt to encourage and promote it; and it’s
only when there’s a very unusual combination of factors
that virtuous behaviour goes entirely unrewarded. •What
reward is best for encouraging hard work, prudence, and
reasonable caution? Success in every sort of business. And
is it possible that someone with these virtues should go
through his whole life without any such success? Wealth
and external honours are the proper reward for those virtues,
and they nearly always produce it. •What reward is best for
promoting the practice of truth, justice, and humaneness?
The conﬁdence, respect, and love of those we live with.
Humaneness doesn’t want to be great; it wants to be beloved.
Truth and justice don’t rejoice in being wealthy but in being
believed and trusted, and those are rewards that those
virtues must almost always acquire. A good man may by
some extraordinary and unlucky circumstances come to be
suspected of a crime of which he is entirely incapable, and on
that account be unjustly exposed for the rest of his life to the
horror and aversion of mankind. By an accident of this kind
he may be said to lose his all, despite his integrity and justice;
just as a cautious and prudent man may be ruined by an
earthquake or a ﬂood. Accidents of the ﬁrst (unjust life-long
suspicion) kind are perhaps even rarer—more contrary to the

87

Smith on Moral Sentiments

General rules of morality

general run of events—than those of the second (earthquake
or ﬂood); and it’s still true that the practice of truth, justice,
and humanity is an almost infallible method of acquiring
what those virtues chieﬂy aim at, namely the conﬁdence
and love of those we live with.
[Smith points out that an
unjust suspicion will be less likely to stick if the victim of it
is known to be in general a good man, and makes similar
remarks about the chances of someone’s getting away with a
bad action if he habitually behaves badly.]

So the general rules by which prosperity and adversity
are commonly distributed, when considered in this cool
and philosophical light, appear to be perfectly suited to the
situation of mankind in this life; but they are by no means
suited to some of our natural sentiments.
•We have so
much natural love and admiration for some virtues that we
would like them to be rewarded with all sorts of honours and
rewards, including ones that we know to be proper rewards
for other qualities that don’t always accompany the virtues
in question. Magnanimity, generosity, and justice command
so much admiration that we want to see them crowned
with wealth, power, honours of every kind, these rewards
being the natural consequences of prudence, hard work,
and persistence—qualities that don’t necessarily accompany
magnanimity etc. •And we loathe some vices so much that
we would like to heap onto them every sort of disgrace and
disaster, including ones that are the natural consequences of
different qualities. Fraud, falsehood, brutality, and violence
arouse in every human breast such scorn and hatred that
our indignation ﬂares up when we see them possess advan-
tages that they may in some sense be said to have merited by
the diligence and hard work with which they are sometimes
attended.

The hard-working knave cultivates the soil; the lazy
good man leaves it uncultivated. Who ought to reap

the harvest? which of them should starve, and which
should live in plenty?

The natural course of things decides this in favour of the
knave; the natural sentiments of mankind decide in favour
of the man of virtue. We judge that the good qualities
of the knave are greatly overpaid by the advantages that
they tend to bring him, and that the omissions of the good
man are much too severely punished by the distress that
they naturally bring on him. And human laws, which are
consequences of human sentiments, take the life and the
estate of the hard-working and careful •traitor, and provide
extraordinary rewards for the ﬁdelity and public spirit of
·I have stated
the imprudent and careless •good citizen.
this in terms of •Nature versus •human sentiments, but of
course those sentiments are themselves parts of Nature·. So
what is happening here is that man is directed by •Nature to
correct somewhat the distribution of things that •she herself
would otherwise have made. The rules she prompts him to
follow for this purpose are different from the ones that she
herself observes. She bestows on every virtue (and every
vice) the precise reward (or punishment) that is best ﬁtted
to encourage (or restrain) it. That is all she aims to do; she
doesn’t attend to the different degrees of merit (or demerit)
that actions seem to have when viewed from the standpoint
of human sentiments and passions. Man, on the other hand,
attends only to this; he would like every virtue (or vice) to be
rewarded (or punished) to a degree that exactly matches the
degree of love and esteem (or contempt and abhorrence) that
he himself has for it. The rules that Nature follows are ﬁt for
her, and those that man follows are ﬁt for him; but both are
calculated to promote the same great end, the order of the
world and the perfection and happiness of human nature.

In his work of altering the distribution of things that nat-
ural events would make if they were left to themselves, man

88

Smith on Moral Sentiments

General rules of morality

is like the gods of the poets: he is perpetually intervening by
extraordinary means in favour of virtue and in opposition to
vice, trying to turn away the arrow aimed at the head of the
righteous and to accelerate the sword of destruction lifted up
against the wicked. But he can’t make the fortune of either
the righteous or the wicked perfectly suitable to his own
sentiments and wishes. •The natural course of events can’t
be entirely controlled by man’s weak endeavours; the current
is too rapid and too strong for him to stop it; and though the
·natural· rules that direct •it seem to have been established
for the wisest and best purposes, they sometimes produce
effects that shock all man’s natural sentiments. These rules:

•A large body of men will prevail over a small one,
•Those who launch a project with forethought and
all necessary preparation will prevail over those who
oppose them without any forethought or preparation;
·are special cases of the more general rule, which is my
present topic·,

•No end can be achieved except by means that Nature
has established for achieving it.

This rule seems to be not only necessary and unavoidable in
itself, but even useful for getting men to pay attention and
get to work. But when as a result of this rule violence and
trickery prevail over sincerity and justice, what indignation it
arouses in the breast of every human spectator! What sorrow
and compassion for the sufferings of the innocent, and what
furious resentment against the success of the oppressor!
We are equally •grieved and •enraged at the wrong that is
done, but we often ﬁnd that we have no power to set it right.
When this happens—when we despair of ﬁnding any force on
earth that can check the triumph of injustice—we naturally
appeal to heaven, in the hope that in the after-life the great
Author of our nature •will himself carry out the things that
we have tried to carry out in this life under prompting by

the principles that he has given us for the direction of our
conduct; •will complete the plan that he has taught us to
begin; and •will treat each person according to the works he
has performed in this world. And so we are led to believe in
a future state not only by the weaknesses of human nature
and its hopes and fears, but also by the noblest and best
action-drivers that it has—the love of virtue and hatred of
vice and injustice. . . .

When the general rules that determine the merit and
demerit of actions come in this way to be regarded as the
•laws of an all-powerful Being who watches over our conduct
and who will in a life to come reward the observance of •them
and punish the breach of •them, this endows them with a
new sacredness. Nobody who believes that there is a Deity
can doubt that the supreme rule of our conduct ought to
be respect for the will of the Deity. The very thought of
disobedience seems to have the most shocking wrongness
built into it. How pointless and absurd it would be for man
to oppose or neglect the commands laid on him by ·God’s·
inﬁnite wisdom and inﬁnite power. How unnatural, how
impiously ungrateful, not to reverence the laws that were
prescribed to him by the inﬁnite goodness of his Creator,
even if there weren’t to be any punishment for violating them.
The sense of propriety is also backed by the strongest motives
of self-interest. The idea that. . . .we are always acting under
the eye of God, always exposed to the punishments of that
great avenger of injustice, is a motive capable of restraining
the most headstrong passions in anyone who has constantly
thought about divine punishment and thus become familiar
with the idea of it.

That is how religion reinforces the natural sense of duty;
and it’s the reason why mankind are generally disposed to
trust the honesty of those who seem deeply impressed with
religious sentiments. . . . Mankind assume that the religious

89

Smith on Moral Sentiments

Sense of duty

man is inﬂuenced as everyone else is by

•a concern for the propriety of action,
•a concern for reputation, and
•a desire for the applause of his own breast as well as
for the applause of others,

but they think that the religious man is subject to another
restraint as well, and never knowingly does anything that
he wouldn’t do in the presence of ·God·, that great superior
who will eventually reward or punish him according to his
deeds. . . . People undoubtedly judge rightly on this matter,
and are right to place a double conﬁdence in the rightness of
the religious man’s behaviour in any context where the ﬁrst
duty that religion requires is to fulﬁll all the obligations of
morality. But this extra conﬁdence of theirs is not justiﬁed
in any context where •the natural principles of religion are
corrupted by the quarrelsome and partisan zeal of some
worthless clique or sect, or where •men are taught to regard
trivial ceremonies as more immediate duties of religion than
acts of justice and beneﬁcence, and to imagine that by
sacriﬁces and ceremonies and pointless begging they can
bargain with the Deity for ·permission to engage in· fraud,
perﬁdy, and violence!

Chapter 6: When should the sense of duty be the
sole driver of our conduct? and when should it
co-operate with other motives?

Religion provides such strong motives for the practice of
virtue, and guards us by such powerful restraints from the
temptations of vice, that many writers have thought that
religious principles are the sole praiseworthy motives for
action. Their view has been this:

We ought not to reward from •gratitude or punish from
•resentment; and we ought not to protect the helpless-

ness of our children, or support the inﬁrmities of our
parents, from •natural affection. We should cleanse
our breasts of all affections for particular objects,
replacing them by one great affection, namely the love
of God, the desire •to make ourselves agreeable to him
and •to direct every detail of our conduct according to
his will. We ought not to be grateful from gratitude,
charitable from humaneness, public-spirited from the
love of our country, or generous and just from the
love of mankind. The sole driver and motive of our
conduct in performing all those duties ought to be a
sense that God has commanded us to perform them.
I shan’t stop now to examine this position in detail, and will
only remark that it’s surprising to ﬁnd it accepted by any
sect who claim to belong to a religion in which, after the ﬁrst
precept, •to love the Lord our God with all our heart, with
all our soul, and with all our strength, has as its second
precept •to love our neighbour as we love ourselves—because
we love ourselves, surely, for our own sakes and not merely
because we are commanded to do so! Christianity doesn’t
teach that the sense of duty should be the only driver of our
conduct, but only that it should be the dominant one, which
is also said by philosophy and indeed by common sense.
Still, questions can arise about what distinguishes •cases
where our actions ought to arise chieﬂy or entirely from a
sense of duty or regard to general rules from •cases where
some other sentiment or affection ought to join in and have
a principal inﬂuence.

This distinction (which perhaps can’t be made very pre-
cise) depends on two things: (1) the natural agreeableness
or ugliness of the sentiment or affection that would prompt
us to act without any regard for general rules; and (2) the
precision and exactness, or the looseness and imprecision,
of the general rules themselves.

90

Smith on Moral Sentiments

Sense of duty

(1) I repeat, how far our actions ought to arise from a
given affection rather than being based entirely on regard
for a general rule depends on the natural agreeableness or
ugliness of the affection itself.

All the graceful and admired actions to which the benevo-
lent affections would prompt us ought to be based as much
on the passions themselves as on any concern with general
rules of conduct. A benefactor will think he has been poorly
repaid if the beneﬁciary, in acknowledging the help he has
been given, is acting merely from a cold sense of duty, with
no affection towards the benefactor personally. A husband
is dissatisﬁed with the most obedient wife when he imagines
that her conduct is driven by nothing except her regard for
what the marriage relation requires. A parent whose son,
though not failing in any part of ﬁlial duty, isn’t acting from
the affectionate reverence that would be so appropriate, can
fairly complain of his indifference. And a son couldn’t be
quite satisﬁed with a parent who, while performing all the
duties of his ·parental· situation, has none of the fatherly
fondness that might have been expected from him. With
regard to all such benevolent and social affections, it is
agreeable to see the sense of duty coming into play as a
restraint rather than as a driver, •stopping us from doing
too much rather than to •prompting us to do what we ought.
It gives us pleasure to see a father obliged to restrain his
own fondness, a friend obliged to set limits to his natural
generosity, a person who has received a beneﬁt obliged to
restrain the naively enthusiastic gratitude arising from his
own frame of mind.

When it comes to the malevolent and unsocial passions

the contrary maxim holds. Whereas we ought

to reward from the gratitude and generosity of our
own hearts, without reluctance and without being
obliged to think about how right rewarding is,

we ought always

to punish with reluctance, more from a sense of the
rightness of punishing than from any savage disposi-
tion to get revenge.

Nothing is more graceful than the behaviour of someone who
seems to resent the greatest injuries more from a sense that
they deserve resentment, are proper objects of it, than from
himself feeling the furies of that disagreeable passion. That
is someone •who (like a judge) considers only the general
rule that settles what vengeance is due for each particular
offence; •who in acting on that rule feels less for what he has
suffered than for what the offender is going to suffer; •who,
though he is angry, remembers mercy and is disposed to
interpret the rule in the gentlest and most merciful way that
fair-minded humaneness could permit, consistently with
good sense.

I remarked at the start of I.ii.5 [page 22] that the selﬁsh
passions occupy a sort of middle place, between the social
affections and the unsocial ones. They’re in the middle
In all small and ordinary
in our present context also.
cases the pursuit of objects of individual self-interest ought
to ﬂow from a regard for the general rules that prescribe
such conduct, rather than from any passion for the objects
themselves. Even the most ordinary tradesman would be
lowered in the opinion of his neighbours if he earnestly
plotted to gain or to save a shilling. However poor he is, he
shouldn’t let his conduct express any attention to any such
small matters for the sake of the things themselves. His
situation may require him to be severely economical and
carefully exact about money, but each particular exercise
of that economy and care must come not so much from
•a concern for that particular saving or gain as from •respect
for the general rule that rigorously commands such a tenor
of conduct. His parsimony today mustn’t come from a desire

91

Smith on Moral Sentiments

Sense of duty

for the particular threepence that he will save by it; and his
attendance in his shop mustn’t come from a passion for the
particular tenpence he will acquire by it. Rather, both of
these ought to come purely from a regard for the general
rule, which prescribes with unrelenting severity this plan of
conduct to every tradesman. That is how the character of
a •miser differs from the character of a •person who works
hard and is careful with money. •One is anxious about small
matters for their own sake; •the other attends to them only
in consequence of the scheme of life that he has laid down
to himself.

It is quite otherwise with regard to the more extraordi-
nary and important objects of self-interest. A person who
doesn’t pursue these with some earnestness for their own
sake appears mean-spirited. We would despise a prince who
wasn’t anxious about conquering or defending a province.
We would have little respect for a private gentleman who
didn’t make an effort to gain an estate or a considerable
position in government, when he could get them without
doing anything mean or wrong. A member of parliament who
shows no keenness about getting re-elected is abandoned
by his friends as altogether unworthy of their support. Even
a tradesman is thought a poor-spirited fellow among his
neighbours if he doesn’t bestir himself to get a special job
or some uncommon advantage. This spirit and keenness
constitutes the difference between an enterprising man and
a dully regular one. . . .

(2) I also repeat: how far our actions ought to arise from a
given affection rather than being based entirely on regard for
a general rule will depend partly on what the relevant general
rule is like—where it comes on the scale from •precise and
exact through to •loose and imprecise.

The general rules of most of the virtues—the rules that
ﬁx how we are to behave in matters of prudence, charity,

generosity, gratitude, friendship—are in many respects loose
and imprecise, admitting of so many exceptions and needing
so many riders and qualiﬁcations that it’s hardly possible
to regulate our conduct entirely in terms of them. Because
the common proverbial maxims of •prudence are based on
everyone’s experience, they are perhaps the best general
rules that can be given about •it. But it would be obvious and
ridiculous pedantry to make a show of strictly and literally
abiding by them. Of the virtues I have just listed, gratitude
may be the one whose rules are the most precise and admit
of the fewest exceptions. Thus:

As soon as we can, we should give to our benefactor
something that is at least as valuable as what he has
given us

—that seems to be a pretty plain rule, and one that admits of
hardly any exceptions. But look into this rule just a little and
you’ll see that it is extremely loose and imprecise, and admits
of ten thousand exceptions. If your benefactor attended you
in your sickness, ought you to attend him in his? or can you
fulﬁll the obligation of gratitude by repaying him in some
other way? If you ought to attend him, for how long ought
you to do so? For the same time that he attended you, or
longer, and how much longer? If your friend lent you money
in your distress, ought you to lend him money in his? How
much ought you to lend him? When ought you to lend it
to him? Now, or tomorrow, or next month? And for how
long a time? Obviously no general rule can be laid down
that will give a precise answer to any of these questions.
The difference between his character and yours, between his
circumstances and yours, may be such that this could be
the case:

He lends you money, for which you are perfectly
grateful; you refuse to lend him a halfpenny; and
you are quite right to do so;

92

Smith on Moral Sentiments

Sense of duty

or this:

He lends you money; you are willing to lend or even to
give him ten times as much as he lent you; and this
shows you to be guilty of the blackest ingratitude, not
having fulﬁlled the hundredth part of your obligation
to him.

Yet the general rules governing the duties of gratitude—which
may be the most sacred of all the duties that the beneﬁcent
virtues prescribe to us—are the most precise. The rules
setting out the actions required by friendship, humaneness,
hospitality, generosity, are even more vague and indetermi-
nate.

But there is one virtue whose general rules determine
with the greatest exactness every action that it requires.
This virtue is justice. The rules of justice are enormously
precise, and don’t allow for any exceptions or modiﬁcations
other than ones that can be ascertained as precisely as the
rules themselves (in fact most of them follow from the same
principles as the rules of justice do).
If I owe a man ten
pounds, justice requires that I should pay him precisely ten
pounds, either at the time agreed on or when he demands
it. What I ought to perform, how much I ought to perform,
when and where I ought to perform it, the whole nature
and circumstances of the action prescribed, are all precisely
ﬁxed and determined.
It may be clumsy and pedantic to
make a show of too strictly keeping to the common rules
of prudence or generosity, but no pedantry is involved in
holding ﬁrmly to the rules of justice. Quite the contrary!
The most sacred respect is due to them; and the actions
that justice requires are most properly performed when
the chief motive for performing them is a reverential and
religious respect for the general rules that require them. In
the exercise of any of the other virtues, our conduct should
be directed by a certain idea of rightness, a certain taste

for a particular tenor of conduct, rather than by obedience
to a precise maxim or rule; and ·when a rule does come
into it·, we should attend less to •the rule itself than to
•what it is for and •what it is based on. But that’s not how
things stand with justice. Faced with the question ‘What
does justice require me to do in this situation?’, the man
who does •least in the way of hair-splitting and who adheres
with the •most obstinate steadfastness to the general rules of
justice themselves is the •most commendable man and the
one who can •most be depended on. What the rules of justice
are for is to stop us from harming our neighbour; but it can
often be a crime to break them in cases where we could make
some sort of case for the view that this particular breach
couldn’t harm anyone. A man often becomes a villain the
moment he begins, even in his own heart, to chicane in this
manner [i.e. to engage in tricky, hair-splitting, special pleading]. The
moment he thinks of departing from the most staunch and
positive adherence to what those unbreakable rules tell him
to do, he is no longer to be trusted, and there’s no telling how
far down the path of guilt he may go. The thief imagines that
he does nothing wrong when he steals from the rich, stealing
things that (he supposes) they can easily do without, things
that they may indeed never even know to have been stolen
from them. The adulterer imagines that he does nothing
wrong when he corrupts his friend’s wife, provided he hides
his affair from the suspicion of the husband and doesn’t
disturb the peace of the family. Once we begin to give way
to such subtleties, there is no wickedness so gross that we
couldn’t be capable of it.

We can compare •the rules of justice to the •rules of

indeterminate, and give us only a general idea of the perfec-
tion we ought to aim at, rather than giving us any certain
and infallible directions for achieving it. . . .

It can happen that we seriously and earnestly want to
act so as to deserve approval, but mistake the proper rules
of conduct and are thus misled by the very principle that
·Although our conduct here is in a
ought to direct us.
way conscientious·, it’s no use expecting people entirely to
approve of our behaviour. They can’t enter into the absurd
idea of duty that inﬂuenced us, or go along with any of
the actions that followed from it. But there is something
respectworthy in the character and behaviour of someone
who is in this way betrayed into vice by a wrong sense of
duty, or by what is called ‘an erroneous conscience’. However
bad the upshot of his mistake, generous and humane people
will view him more with pity than with hatred or resentment.
They will lament the weakness of human nature, which
exposes us to such unfortunate delusions even while we
are •sincerely working to achieve perfection and •trying to
act in accordance with the best principle that can possibly
direct us. What causes such gross perversions of our natural
sentiments? The culprit is nearly always some false notion
of religion. ·There is a reason for that·: the source of the
greatest authority of the rules of duty is the only one that
can distort our ideas of them to any considerable extent.
In all other cases common sense is sufﬁcient to direct us
to something that is not far from the most exact rightness
of conduct; and as long as we earnestly want to do well,
our behaviour will always be praiseworthy on the whole.
Everyone agrees that the ﬁrst rule of duty is to obey the will
of God. But when it comes to the speciﬁc commandments
that God’s will may impose on us, men differ widely from
one another. So this is a matter requiring the greatest
restraint and mutual toleration; and although the defence of

society requires that crimes should be punished, whatever
the motives for them were, •a good man will always punish
them reluctantly when they have clearly come from false
notions of religious duty. •He will regret and sometimes even
admire the unfortunate ﬁrmness and conscientiousness ·of
the deluded criminals· at the very time that he punishes
their crime; he won’t have against them the indignation
that he feels against other criminals.
In Voltaire’s ﬁne
tragedy Mahomet [full title: Mahomet, or Fanaticism] there is a
good presentation of what ought to be our sentiments for
crimes that come from such motives. (This is one of the most
interesting spectacles that was ever presented on any stage,
and perhaps the most instructive one.) In Voltaire’s tragedy
two innocent and virtuous young people. . . .are driven by
the strongest motives of a false religion to commit a horrible
murder, one that shocks all the principles of human nature.
A venerable old man is pointed out to them as a sacriﬁce
that God has explicitly demanded from them, and they are
ordered to kill him. (The old man has expressed the most
tender affection for them both; they have both felt the highest
reverence and esteem for him, although he is an open enemy
of their religion; and he is their father, though they don’t
know this—they don’t even know that they are brother and
sister.) Facing the prospect of committing this crime, they
are tortured with all the agonies that can arise from the
struggle between

•the idea of the indispensableness of religious duty

on one side and

•compassion, gratitude, reverence for the age, and
love for the humanity and virtue of the person they
are going to destroy

on the other. But the sense of duty eventually prevails over
all the likeable weaknesses of human nature. They carry out
the crime that was demanded of them, then immediately

94

Smith on Moral Sentiments

Sense of duty

learn their error and the fraud that had deceived them,
and are driven wild with horror, remorse, and resentment.
The way we do feel towards this unhappy pair is how we
ought to feel for anyone who is in this manner misled by
religion—provided we are sure that it really is religion that
misleads him, and not the pretence of it that has been used
to cover some of the worst human passions.

Just as a person may act wrongly by following a wrong
sense of duty, so nature may lead him to act rightly in
opposition to such a wrong sense. When this happens,
we can’t be unpleased to see the victory go to the motive
that we think ought to prevail, though the person himself
is so misguided as to think otherwise. But because his
conduct is an effect of weakness and not of principle, we
are far from giving it our complete approval.
[Smith wrote
‘so weak as to think otherwise’, but this was surely a slip. The phrase
‘an effect of weakness’ is all right; it can refer to the person’s ‘weakness’
in not doing what he thinks to be his duty.] Take the case of a
bigoted Roman Catholic who is present at the massacre of
St Bartholomew, and is so overcome by compassion that
he saves some unhappy Protestants whom he thinks it his

duty to destroy. He doesn’t seem to be entitled to the high
applause that we would have given him if he had exerted that
same generosity with complete self-approval. We might be
pleased with the humaneness of his feelings, but we would
still regard him with a sort of •pity that is ﬂatly inconsistent
with the •admiration that is owed to perfect virtue. It’s the
same case with all the other passions. We don’t dislike seeing
them lead the person to behave rightly, even when his false
notion of duty directs him to restrain them. Suppose that a
devout Quaker is struck on one cheek and instead of turning
up the other he so completely forgets his literal interpretation
of our Saviour’s precept and bestows some good discipline
on the brute who hit him. We wouldn’t ﬁnd this disagreeable!
We would laugh and enjoy his spirit, liking him all the better
because of it. But we wouldn’t regard him with anything
close to the respect and esteem that would seem to be owing
to someone who on such an occasion had acted rightly from
a just sense of what was the right thing to do. No action can
properly be called virtuous unless it is accompanied with the
sentiment of self-approval.

The beauty of works of art

Part IV: The effect of utility on the sentiment of approval

Chapter 1: The beauty that the appearance of
utility gives to all the productions of art, and the
widespread inﬂuence of this type of beauty

But there’s another fact ·about utility and beauty· that
hasn’t previously been noticed by anyone, so far as I know.
It is this:

Everyone who has thought hard about what constitutes the
nature of beauty has seen that one of its principal sources
is utility. Someone looking over a house gets pleasure
from its convenience as well as from its ·formal· regularity
[and, Smith adds with a rather obscure example, he is as
much displeased when he sees features of the house that
interfere with its function as when he sees features that are
aesthetically displeasing. Then:] The ﬁtness of any system
or machine to produce the end for which it was intended
confers a certain rightness and beauty on the whole thing,
making it a pleasure to think about—and this is so obvious
that nobody has overlooked it.

Why is utility so pleasing? This has been answered
by Hume [whom Smith doesn’t name, but identiﬁes through a series
of compliments to his thought and writing]. According to him, a
thing’s utility pleases its owner by continually suggesting to
him the pleasure or convenience that it is ﬁtted to promote.
Every time he looks at it he is reminded of this pleasure, so
that the object in question becomes a source of continual
satisfaction and enjoyment. The spectator’s sympathy leads
him to have the sentiments of the owner, making him view
the object in that same agreeable light. When we visit the
palaces of the great, we can’t help feeling the satisfaction that
we would enjoy if we were the owners of so much ingeniously
contrived accommodation. And he gives a similar account of
why the appearance of inconvenience should make an object
disagreeable to the owner and to the spectator.

An artifact’s being skillfully designed so as to be
suitable for some purpose is often valued more than
is the purpose itself; exact adjustment of the means
for attaining some convenience or pleasure is often
valued more highly than the convenience or pleasure
itself, though they would seem to be the sole source
of the artifact’s merit.

Although this phenomenon hasn’t been noticed before, it is
quite common, and can be observed in a thousand instances,
both in the most trivial and in the most important concerns
of human life.

A man comes into his chamber and ﬁnds the chairs all
standing in the middle of the room; he is angry with his
servant; and rather than see the chairs stay there he takes
the trouble himself to put them all in their proper places
with their backs to the wall. The whole propriety of this
new state of affairs comes from its greater convenience in
leaving the ﬂoor free and disengaged. To get this convenience
he gives himself more trouble than he could have suffered
from the lack of it; because he could easily have sat down
on one of the chairs, which is probably what he does when
his work is ﬁnished. So it seems that what he wanted was
not so much •this convenience as •an arrangement of things
that promotes it. Yet this convenience is what ultimately
recommends that arrangement, giving it all its propriety and
beauty.

Another example: A watch that loses two minutes a day
is despised by its owner, who cares about watches. He sells

96

Smith on Moral Sentiments

The beauty of works of art

it for a couple of guineas and spends ﬁfty guineas on a new
watch that won’t lose more than thirty seconds a week. Now,
the only use of watches is to tell us what the time is, to save
us from missing an appointment or suffering some other
inconvenience through not knowing the time; but the person
who is so choosy about his watch won’t always be found
to be more scrupulously punctual than other men, or more
anxiously concerned for any other reason to know precisely
what time of day it is. What interests him is not so much
•the acquiring of this piece of knowledge as •the perfection
of the machine that enables him to acquire it.

It’s common for people to ruin themselves by spending
money on trinkets that are useful in some trivial way. What
pleases these lovers of toys is not so much •the use they
make of their little machines as •the machines’ ﬁtness to
be used. Their pockets are stuffed with little conveniences;
they have new pockets, unknown in the clothes of other
people, in order to carry a greater number ·of ‘useful’ gad-
gets·. They walk around about loaded with a multitude of
baubles,. . . .some of which may sometimes be of some little
use, but all of which might at all times be well done without.
The whole use that is made of them is certainly not worth
the fatigue of bearing the burden!

And it’s not only with regard to such trivial objects that
our conduct is inﬂuenced by this motive—·this liking for
things because of what they could do, without much interest
in having them actual do those things·. It is often the secret
motive of very serious and important pursuits in both private
and public life.

Consider the case of a poor man’s son whom heaven in
its anger has infected with ambition. When he begins to look
around him, he admires the condition of the rich. [Smith
goes into details: the convenience of larger home, the ease of
riding on horseback and of having servants to do everything,

and so on; and his idea that with all these conveniences
of wealth he would be contentedly idle. Then:] He devotes
himself for ever to the pursuit of wealth and greatness. To get
the conveniences that these provide, he works, giving himself
in the ﬁrst year—indeed in the ﬁrst month—of his work more
fatigue of body and more anxiety of mind than he would have
suffered through the whole of his life from the lack of wealth.
He works to distinguish himself in some laborious profession,
labouring night and day to acquire talents superior to those
of his competitors. He then tries to bring those talents
into public view, taking every chance to get employment.
For this purpose he makes himself pleasant to everyone,
serves people whom he hates, and is deferential to people he
despises. Throughout his life he pursues the idea of a certain
artiﬁcial and elegant repose •which he may never arrive at,
•for which he sacriﬁces a real tranquillity that is always in
his power, and •which, if in old age he at last achieves it, he
will ﬁnd to be in no way preferable to the humble security
and contentment that he had gave up in order to pursue
wealth and greatness. Then. . . .he will start to learn that
wealth and greatness are only trivially useful, mere trinkets,
no more ﬁt for procuring ease of body or tranquillity of mind
than the tweezer-cases of the lover of toys; and, also like
them, giving trouble to the person who carries them around
with him that far outweighs any advantages they can provide
him with. [Smith develops this comparison at great length.
The useful little ‘toys’, he says, may actually be as useful as a
grand house or a retinue of servants, he says, but the owner
of the ‘toys’ won’t be admired and envied as much as the
owner of the things that wealth and greatness procure. The
only real advantage of the latter is the attitude of other people
to the wealthy great man. But that (Smith continues) throws
our attention onto the admiring spectators: why do they so
much admire the condition of the wealthy man? It’s not that

97

Smith on Moral Sentiments

The beauty of works of art

they think he is happier than other people; the object of their
admiration is the wealthy man’s ownership of so many things
that are ﬁtted to produce ease and happiness. Having thus
brought the wheel full circle, Smith returns to the state of
the wealthy man in old age:] In his heart he curses ambition,
and vainly pines for the ease and idleness of youth, pleasures
that are gone for ever, having been foolishly sacriﬁced for
something that can’t give him real satisfaction now that he
has it. That’s how things look to every wealthy man who is
led by depression or disease to attend to his own situation
and to think about why he is actually so unhappy. Power
and riches appear then to be what they actually are. . . . They
are immense structures

•which it takes a lifetime’s work to build,
•which are constantly threatening to ·collapse and·
overwhelm the person who lives in them, and
•which, while they stand, may save him from some
smaller inconveniences but can’t protect him from
any of the severer harshnesses of the season.

the summer shower (·to continue the
They keep off
metaphor·) but not the winter storm. They always leave
the rich man as much—sometimes even more—exposed to
anxiety, fear, and sorrow; to diseases, danger, and death.

Any of us when ill or depressed may have this view of
things, entirely depreciating the great objects of human
desire; but when we’re in better health and a better mood we
always see them in a more favourable light. When we are in
pain and sorrow our imagination seems to be conﬁned and
cooped up within our own persons, but in times of ease and
prosperity it expands itself to everything around us. Then
we are charmed by the beauty of the accommodation that
palaces provide, and the living arrangements of the great;
and we admire how everything is ﬁtted to promoting their
ease, anticipating their wants, gratifying their wishes, and

entertaining their most trivial desires. If we take the real
satisfaction that any of these things is capable providing,
and consider it in itself, independently of the beauty of
the arrangement that is ﬁtted to promote it, it will always
appear to be enormously negligible and trivial. But we don’t
often look at it in this abstract and philosophical way. We
naturally run it together it in our imagination with the order,
the regular and harmonious movement, of the system or
machine. . . .that produces it. The pleasures of wealth and
greatness, when considered in this complex view, strike the
imagination as something grand and beautiful and noble, the
attainment of which is well worth all the toil and anxiety that
we are so apt to bestow on it. [By ‘this complex view’ Smith means
the way of looking at the thing that runs together •the thing’s ﬁtness to
produce a certain result and •the pleasures of that result.]

[From here to the end of this chapter, Smith goes on at undue length
about matters that aren’t central to his announced main topic in the
chapter. That material won’t be much abbreviated here, because it’s a
notable precursor of ideas that Smith was to present 17 years later in
The Wealth of Nations, widely regarded as the ﬁrst work in theoretical
economics. We ﬁnd here the phrase ‘invisible hand’, which was made
famous by the later work.]

It’s just as well that nature deceives us in this way. This
deception is what starts men working and keeps them at
it.
It is what ﬁrst prompted men to cultivate the soil, to
build houses, to found cities and commonwealths, and to
invent and improve all the sciences and arts that make
human life noble and glorious, having entirely changed
the whole face of the globe, turning the nature’s primitive
forests into agreeable and fertile plains, and making the
trackless and barren ocean a new source of food and the
great high road of communication to the different nations
of the earth. These human labours have required the earth
to redouble her natural fertility, and to maintain a greater

98

Smith on Moral Sentiments

The beauty of works of art

number of inhabitants. The proud and unfeeling landlord
views his extensive ﬁelds and—without a thought for the
wants of anyone else—imaginatively consumes himself the
whole harvest that grows on them; but what of it? The
homely and common proverb The eye is larger than the belly
is exactly true of this landlord. The capacity of his stomach
bears no proportion to the vastness of his desires, and won’t
receive any more food than does the stomach of the lowest
peasant. He has to distribute the rest among

•those who elegantly prepare the little that he himself
makes use of,
•those who manage the palace in which this little is to
be consumed, and
•those who provide and service all the baubles and
trinkets that have a role in the great man’s way of life.
[Smith isn’t talking about the great man’s tweezers and nail-clippers! He
is implying, through a metaphor, that a carriage and a grand kitchen and
servants’ uniforms etc. are—from a serious and mature point of view—on
a par with such ‘baubles and trinkets’.] Thus, all these people get
•through his luxury and caprice the share of the necessities
of life that they would never have received •through his
humaneness or his justice. The produce of the soil always
maintains just about as many inhabitants as it is capable
of maintaining. All the rich do is to select from the heap the
most precious and agreeable portions. They consume little
more than the poor; and in spite of their natural selﬁshness
and greed, and despite the fact that

they are guided only by their own convenience, and all
they want to get from the labours of their thousands
of employees is the gratiﬁcation of their own empty
and insatiable desires,

they do share with the poor the produce of all their improve-
ments [meaning: their well-cultivated land, their up-to-date ploughs,

their state of the art milking sheds, etc.]. They are led by an
invisible hand to share out life’s necessities in just about the
same way that they would have been shared out if the earth
been divided into equal portions among all its inhabitants.
And so without intending it, without knowing it, they advance
the interests of the society ·as a whole·, and provide means
for the survival of the species. When Providence divided
the earth among a few lordly masters, it didn’t forget or
abandon those who seemed to have been left out in the
distribution—these too enjoy their share of all that the earth
produces. In terms of the real happiness of human life, they
are in no respect inferior to those who seem to be so far above
them. In ease of body and peace of mind, all the different
ranks of life are nearly on a level; the beggar sitting in the
sun beside the highway has the security that kings ﬁght for.
·There are also other motivations that lead to conduct
serving the public good although they don’t involve any
thought of doing such a thing·.
Institutions that tend to
promote the public welfare often arise not from a wish for that
but from a love of system, a regard for the beauty of order, of
art and contrivance. [In Smith’s day any activity could be called an
‘art’ if it involved general techniques needing skill to implement. So clock-
making and plumbing would be ‘arts’. The arts in our narrower sense of
the word are speciﬁcally referred to on page 113 as ‘the superior arts’
and on page 131 as ‘the liberal and ingenious arts’.] When a patriot
makes efforts to improve any part of the nation’s public life,
his conduct doesn’t always arise from pure sympathy with
the happiness of those who are to get the beneﬁt of it. When
a public-spirited man encourages the mending of highways,
it’s not usually from a fellow-feeling with those who earn
their living driving carts or carriages. When a legislature
establishes premiums and other encouragements to advance
the manufacture of linen or woollen garments, its conduct
seldom comes from pure sympathy with the wearer of cheap

99

Smith on Moral Sentiments

Beauty and utility

or ﬁne cloth, let alone sympathy with the manufacturer or
merchant. The perfection of policy, the extension of trade
and manufacturing, are noble and magniﬁcent objectives.
The thought of them pleases us, and we have a concern
with anything that can tend to advance them. They are part
of the great system of government, and the wheels of the
political machine seem to turn more smoothly by means
of them. We do take pleasure in seeing the perfection of
such a beautiful and grand system, and we’re uneasy until
we can remove anything that might in any way disturb or
overload the regularity of its motions. But no constitution
of government is valued except in proportion as it tends to
promote the happiness of those who live under it. That is
its sole use and end—·it’s all it does and all it is for·. And
yet we have certain spirit of system, a certain love of art and
contrivance, that leads us sometimes to seem to value the
means more than the end, and to be eager to promote the
happiness of our fellow-creatures not so much from •any
immediate sense of what they either suffer or enjoy as from •a
desire to perfect and improve a certain beautiful and orderly
·political· system. Some public-spirited men have shown
themselves to be in other respects not very sensitive to the
feelings of humaneness. And there have been men of the
greatest humaneness who seem to have been entirely devoid
of public spirit. You’ll probably ﬁnd in the circle of your
acquaintance instances both these kinds. . . . If you want to
implant public virtue in the breast of someone who seems
not to care about his country’s interests, it will often be no
use telling him about the advantages people get from living
in a well-governed state—that they are better housed, better
clothed, better fed. These considerations make no great
impression on many people. You’ll have a better chance of
persuading your man if you describe the great system of
public policy that procures these advantages, if you explain

the inter-connections of its various parts, the subordination
of some of them to others, and the subservience of all of
them to the happiness of the society; if you show

•how this system might be introduced into his own
country,
•what is obstructing it from existing there at present,
•how those obstructions might be removed, and all the
wheels of the machine of government be made to move
with more harmony and smoothness, without grating
on one another or retarding one another’s motions.

It’s hardly possible that someone should listen to all that
without feeling some degree of public spirit coming to life
within him. He will, at least for the moment, feel some desire
to remove those obstructions and to put into motion that
beautiful and orderly machine. Nothing tends to promote
public spirit as much as the study of politics does—the study
of •the various systems of civil government, their advantages
and disadvantages, of •the constitution of our own country,
its situation and interests in relation to foreign nations, its
commerce, its defence, the disadvantages it struggles with,
the dangers to which it may be exposed, how to remove the
disadvantages and guard against the dangers. . . .

Chapter 2: How the characters and actions of men
are made beautiful by their appearance of utility.
Is our perception of this beauty one of the basic
sources of approval?

The characters of men, as well as the institutions of civil
government that they construct, can be ﬁt to promote or
to disturb the happiness of individuals and of the society.
The prudent, equitable, active, resolute, and sober character
promises prosperity and satisfaction to the person himself
and to everyone connected with him. The rash, insolent,

100

Smith on Moral Sentiments

Beauty and utility

slothful, effeminate, and voluptuous character points to
ruin for the individual and misfortune for everyone who
has anything to do with him. The ﬁrst turn of mind has
at least all the beauty that can belong to the most perfect
machine that was ever invented for promoting the most
agreeable purpose; and the second has all the ugliness
[Smith: ‘deformity’; see note on page 8] of the most awkward and
clumsy contraption. What other •institution of government
could have as much tendency to promote the happiness of
mankind as •the general prevalence of wisdom and virtue?
What government is is merely an imperfect remedy for the
shortage of wisdom and virtue. So any beauty that a civil
government can have because of its utility must in a much
higher degree be a beauty of wisdom and virtue. And on the
other side, no public policy can be as ruinous and destructive
as the vices of ·individual· men. When bad government has
terrible consequences, the way it does so—always—is by
not sufﬁciently guarding against the mischiefs arising from
human wickedness.

This beauty and ugliness that characters seem to derive
from their usefulness or inconvenience are apt to make
their greatest impression on people who are thinking about
the actions and conduct of mankind in an abstract and
philosophical way. When a philosopher sets out to examine
why humaneness is approved of, or why cruelty condemned,
he doesn’t always form a clear and distinct conception of any
one particular action either of cruelty or of humaneness; he
is likely to be contented with the vague and indeterminate
idea that the general names of those qualities suggest to
him. But the propriety or impropriety, the merit or demerit,
of actions stands out clearly only in particular instances.
It’s only when particular examples are given that we get a
clear idea of the concord or disagreement between our own
affections and those of the agent, or feel a social gratitude

towards him in one case and a sympathetic resentment
in the other. When we think about virtue and vice in an
abstract and general manner, the qualities by which they
arouse these various sentiments seem to a large extent
to disappear, and the sentiments themselves become less
obvious and noticeable. Instead, the good effects of virtue
and the disastrous consequences of vice seem then to rise
up, to stand out, to distinguish themselves from all the other
qualities of virtue and vice.

The same able and enjoyable author who ﬁrst explained
why utility pleases us—·David Hume·—has been so struck
with this view of things that he has reduced all our approval
of virtue to a perception of the kind of beauty that results
from the appearance of utility. He says that

•the only qualities of the mind that are approved of as
virtuous are ones that are useful or agreeable either
to the person himself or to other people; and
•the only qualities that are disapproved of as vicious
are ones that have the opposite tendency.

If you look into this carefully you’ll ﬁnd, I think, that this is
entirely correct. That’s apparently because Nature has neatly
adjusted our sentiments of approval and disapproval to ·ﬁt·
the convenience of the individual and of the society. But I
maintain that our view of this utility or harmfulness isn’t
the ﬁrst source, or the principal source, of our approval and
disapproval. These sentiments ·of approval or disapproval·
are no doubt enriched and enlivened by our perception
of the beauty or ugliness that results from this utility or
harmfulness; but they are basically and essentially different
from this perception. Here are two reasons for saying this.
(1) It seems impossible that our approval of virtue should
be a sentiment of the same kind as we have when we approve
of a convenient and well-designed building; or that we should
have no reason for praising a man except one that would

101

Smith on Moral Sentiments

Beauty and utility

also be a reason for commending a chest of drawers!

(2) If you look into it you’ll ﬁnd that our approval of a
given state of mind is seldom based primarily on its utility,
and that the sentiment of approval always has as one of its
components a sense of propriety that is quite distinct from
the perception of utility. We can see this with regard to all
the qualities that are approved of as virtuous—the ones that
are (according to me) valued as useful to ourselves, as well as
those that are valued because of their usefulness to others.
The qualities that are most useful to ourselves are (a)
superior reason and understanding, enabling us to work
out what consequences, good or bad, are likely to result
from our actions; and (b) self-control, enabling us to abstain
from present pleasure (or endure present unpleasure) in
order to get greater pleasure (or avoid greater unpleasure) at
some future time. The virtue of prudence, which is of all the
virtues the one that is most useful to the individual, consists
in the union of those two qualities—·i.e. in the combination
of •superior reason and understanding and •self-control·.

(a) Superior reason and understanding are—as I pointed
out earlier [page 8]—basically approved of as just and right
and precise, not merely as useful or advantageous. The
greatest and most admired exercises of human reason have
been in the abstruser sciences, especially the higher parts of
mathematics; but it’s not very obvious that those sciences
are useful to individuals or to the public, and to show that
they are would require a train of thought of which some
parts would be hard to grasp. So it wasn’t •their utility
that ﬁrst recommended the mathematical sciences to public
admiration.
•This quality wasn’t emphasized at all until
there came to be a need for some reply to the reproaches of
people who, having no taste for such sublime discoveries,
tried to dismiss them as useless.

(b) The exercise of self-control in restraining our present
appetites so as to gratify them more fully later on is approved
of not only as useful but also, equally, as right. When we act
like that the sentiments that inﬂuence our conduct seem to
coincide exactly with those of the spectator. The spectator
doesn’t feel the tug of our present appetites. To him the
pleasure that we are to enjoy next week or next year matters
just as much as the pleasure that we are to enjoy right
now. When ·our self-control lapses, and· we sacriﬁce the
future for the sake of the present, our conduct appears to
the spectator to be utterly wild and absurd; he can’t enter
into our motivation for behaving like that. On the other side,
when we abstain from present pleasure so as to get greater
pleasure later on, acting as if we were as concerned about
the remote object as we are about the one that presses on
the senses right now, the spectator is bound to approve of
our behaviour because our affections in this matter exactly
correspond with his. Also, he knows from experience how few
are capable of such self-control, so he looks on our conduct
with a considerable degree of wonder and admiration. That
is the source for the enormous respect that all men naturally
have for a steady perseverance in the practice of frugality,
hard work, and application, even when these are directed
solely to the project of becoming rich. [Smith now says all
this again, in only slightly different words. Then:] Without
his consciousness of this deserved approval and respect, the
agent wouldn’t be able to keep up this tenor of conduct [see
note on ‘tenor’ on page 85]. The pleasure that we’re to enjoy ten
years hence concerns us so little in comparison with the
pleasure that we can enjoy to-day, the passion aroused by
the future pleasure is naturally so weak in comparison with
the violent emotion that the present pleasure is apt to give
rise to, that the former could never outweigh the latter unless
it was supported by the sense of propriety, the consciousness

102

Beauty and utility

that we deserve •everyone’s respect and approval if we act in
one of the two ways and •everyone’s contempt and derision
if we act in the other.

Humaneness, justice, generosity, and public spirit are
the qualities most useful to others. I have already explained
what the propriety of humaneness and justice consists in:
I showed how greatly our respect and approval of those
qualities depends on the match between the affections of the
agent and those of the spectators.

Generosity and public spirit are proper for the same
reason that justice is. Don’t confuse generosity with hu-
maneness. Those two qualities seem at ﬁrst sight to be close
relatives of one another, but it isn’t always true that someone
who has one will have the other. Humaneness is the virtue
of a woman, generosity the virtue of a man. The fair sex,
who usually have much more tenderness than we males do,
seldom have as much generosity. That women rarely make
considerable donations is an observation of the civil law.
[That sentence is verbatim Smith.] Humaneness consists merely
in the spectator’s sharp fellow-feeling with the sentiments
of the persons principally concerned—his grieving for their
sufferings, resenting their injuries, and rejoicing at their good
fortune. The most humane actions don’t need self-denial or
self-control or much exercise of the sense of propriety. They
consist only in doing what this sharp sympathy would, on its
own, prompt us to do. But generosity is different. Whenever
we are generous it is because in some respect we put some
other person ahead of ourselves, sacriﬁcing some great and
important interest of our own to an equal interest of a friend
or of a superior. When someone x

gives up his claim to a governmental position that was
the great object of his ambition, because he thinks
that someone else y is better entitled to it,

or when someone x

risks his own life in defence of the life of his friend y,
because he judges y’s life to be more important than
his own,

he isn’t acting from humaneness, feeling y’s concerns more
sharply than he feels his own. He considers those conﬂicting
interests not in the light in which they naturally appear to
•him but in the light in which they appear to •others. All the
bystanders can rightly have a greater concern for y’s success
or preservation than for x’s, but that can’t be x’s position.
So when he sacriﬁces his own interests to those of y, he is
accommodating himself to the sentiments of the spectator,
making an effort of magnanimity to act in accordance with
what he thinks must naturally be the view of the matter that
any third person has. When a soldier gives up his life in
order to defend that of his ofﬁcer, it may be that the death of
that ofﬁcer, if it happened without this soldier’s being at fault,
wouldn’t have affected the soldier much, causing him less
sorrow than a quite small disaster to himself—·e.g. his loss
of a ﬁnger·—would cause. ·So his act of self-sacriﬁce isn’t to
be understood in terms of the relative value of lives·. He is
trying to act so as to deserve applause, giving the impartial
spectator a role in the guidance of his conduct; he feels that
to everyone but himself his own life is a triﬂe compared with
that of his ofﬁcer. . . . [Note with care that he is trying to act so as to
deserve applause; this doesn’t mean that he is trying to win applause.]
[Smith now reworks these same ideas in connection with
‘greater exertions of public spirit’. One example concerns
a soldier who risks his life in an attempt to add to ‘the
dominions of his sovereign’ some little sliver of territory
that he doesn’t care about in the least, on his own account.
Another is historical: ‘the ﬁrst Brutus’ [this is centuries before
the Brutus who was Julius Caesar’s friend and assassin] delivered his
sons up for capital punishment ‘because they had conspired
against the rising liberty of Rome’. In doing this, ‘he viewed

103

Smith on Moral Sentiments

Beauty and utility

them with the eyes not of a father but of a Roman citizen’.
Smith continues:]
In cases like these our admiration is
based not so much on the •utility of the action as on its
•propriety—its unexpected and therefore great, noble, and
exalted propriety. When we take into account the action’s
utility, that undoubtedly gives it a new beauty and still
further recommends it to our approval. But this beauty isn’t
much noticed except by men who reﬂect and theorize; it is
not the quality that ﬁrst recommends such actions to the
natural sentiments of the bulk of mankind.

Notice that insofar as the sentiment of approval arises
from a perception of this beauty of utility, it doesn’t involve
any reference to the sentiments of anyone else. Suppose
it were possible that a person should grow up to manhood
without any communication with society, ·and consider what
his attitudes to his own conduct could be·. His own actions
might be agreeable or disagreeable to him on account of
their tendency to his happiness or disadvantage. He might
perceive beauty of this kind in prudence, temperance, and
good conduct (and ugliness in the opposite behaviour); he
might view his own temperament and character with the

sort of satisfaction we get from a well-contrived machine (or
distaste and dissatisfaction from an awkward and clumsy
contrivance). These perceptions of his, however, would be
merely matters of taste. They would be weak and delicate,
like the perceptions whose correctness is the basis for taste
properly so-called; and someone in this solitary and miser-
able condition probably wouldn’t pay much attention to them.
Even if they did occur to him, they wouldn’t affect him before
he was connected to society in the way they would affect him
after, and because of, the making of that connection. He
wouldn’t be cast down with inward shame at the thought of
this ugliness; nor would he be elated with secret triumph
by the consciousness of the contrary beauty. He wouldn’t
exult from the notion of deserving reward in the one case, or
tremble from the suspicion of deserving punishment in the
other. All such sentiments presuppose the idea of some other
being who is the natural judge of the person that feels them;
and it’s only by sympathy with the decisions of that judge
of his conduct that he can experience either the triumph of
self-applause or the shame of self-condemnation.

Custom and notions of beauty

Part V: The inﬂuence of custom and fashion on the

sentiments of moral approval and disapproval

Chapter 1: The inﬂuence of custom and fashion on
our notions of beauty and ugliness

In addition to the ones I have listed, there are ·two· other
considerable inﬂuences on the moral sentiments of mankind;
they are the main causes of the many irregular and discor-
dant opinions that become dominant in different ages and
nations concerning what is blameworthy or praiseworthy.
These two sources of inﬂuence are •custom and •fashion—
forces that extend their sway over our judgments concerning
beauty of every kind.

When two objects have often been seen together, the
imagination acquires a habit of passing easily from one to
the other: when one appears we’re willing to bet that the
second will follow. With no outside help they put us in mind
of one another, and our attention glides easily along them. If
we didn’t have this habit, we wouldn’t see any real beauty in
their union; but when custom has connected them together
in this way, we feel that something is wrong when they are
separated. We think that one of them is awkward [Smith’s word,
here and below] when it appears without its usual companion;
we miss something that we expected to ﬁnd, and the habitual
arrangement of our ideas is disturbed by the disappointment.
A suit of clothes, for example, seems to lack something if it
doesn’t have some ornament—however insigniﬁcant—that it
usually has. . . . When there is something naturally proper
in the union ·of the two items·, custom increases our sense
of it, and makes a different arrangement appear even more
disagreeable than it would otherwise seem to be. Anything
that is clumsy or awkward will be especially disgusting to

people who have been accustomed to seeing things ·that
were made or chosen or arranged· in good taste. When a
conjunction of items is improper, we’ll have less sense of its
impropriety—perhaps even no sense of it—if it’s something
to which we have become accustomed. Those who have been
accustomed to slovenly disorder lose all sense of neatness or
elegance. . . .

Fashion is different from custom—or, rather, it’s a partic-
ular species of it. Something that everybody wears can’t be
called fashion. The word applies to what is worn by people
who are of a high rank or exceptional character. The graceful,
easy, commanding manners of the great, when joined to the
usual richness and magniﬁcence of their clothing, make the
style they adopt seem graceful. As long as they continue
to use this style, it is connected in our imaginations with
the idea of something genteel and magniﬁcent, so that we
come to see the style itself as genteel and magniﬁcent, even
if there’s nothing special about it considered in itself. As
soon as the higher ranks in society drop it, the style loses
all the grace it seemed to possess before, and instead seems
to have something of the meanness and awkwardness of the
inferior ranks of people who now use it.

[The remaining seven book-pages of this chapter contain a
sober discussion of fashions in the arts. Everyone agrees that
custom and fashion rule in matters of clothing and furniture;
but they also have great inﬂuence over people’s tastes in
music, poetry, and architecture. Some of those fashions
last a long time, because the objects they concern are very
durable—e.g. buildings, poems. Most people know little

105

Smith on Moral Sentiments

Custom and notions of beauty

about what customs and fashions prevailed at other times
and/or in other places, and this ignorance leads them to
downplay fashion and to think that their tastes ‘are founded
on reason and nature, not on habit’. Smith challenges
them on this, demanding to know what objective reason
can be given for the rightness of various time-honoured
features of ancient Greek temples. And fashion governs
literary judgments too. A verse-form that the French regard
as right for tragedy would strike the English as an absurd
vehicle for that kind of dramatic content. Then Smith turns
to the more interesting topic of enforced changes in fashion:]
An eminent artist will bring about a considerable change
in the established modes of any one of those arts, introducing
a new fashion of writing, music, or architecture. Just as the
dress of an agreeable man of high rank recommends itself,
and comes soon to be admired and imitated, however pecu-
liar and fantastic it is, so the excellences of an eminent mas-
ter ·in one of the creative arts· recommend his peculiarities,
and his manner becomes the fashionable style in the art that
he practises. Within the past ﬁfty years the Italians’ taste
in music and architecture has undergone a considerable
change, resulting from imitating the peculiarities of some
eminent masters in each of those arts. [He gives examples
of Latin writers who were criticised for features of their style
that were later followed by many others, and remarks:] A
writer must have many great qualities if he is to be able to
make his very faults agreeable! The highest praise one can
give to an author is to say that he •reﬁned the taste of a
nation; the second highest may be to say that he •corrupted
it!
In our own language,. . . .the quaintness of Butler has
given place to the plainness of Swift. The rambling freedom
of Dryden, and the correct but often tedious and prosaic
languor of Addison, are no longer objects of imitation; all
long verses are now written after the manner of the vigorous

precision of Pope.

And it’s not only over the productions of the •arts that
custom and fashion hold sway. They have the same kind
of inﬂuence over our judgments regarding •natural objects.
Think about the variety of the forms that are found to be
beautiful in different species of things! The proportions
that are admired in one animal are altogether different from
the ones that are valued in another. Every class of things
has its own special conformation—one that is approved of
and has a beauty of its own—distinct from that of every
other species. That is what led Bufﬁer to maintain that
the beauty of any object consists in the form and colour
that are centrally typical of the species to which the object
belongs, because they will be the form and colour that we
are, in our experience of that species, most accustomed to.
[Smith expounds this theory at great length, without doing
much to make it seem worth studying. Smith agrees that
our judgments about things’ beauty are much affected by
what we are used to, but he denies that that’s the whole
story:] The utility of any form, its ﬁtness for the useful
purposes for which it was intended, obviously counts in
its favour and makes it agreeable to us, independently of
custom ·or usualness·. Certain colours are more agreeable
than others, and give more delight to the eye the ﬁrst time
it ever beholds them. A smooth surface is more agreeable
than a rough one. Variety is more pleasing than a tedious
undiversiﬁed uniformity. Connected variety, in which each
new appearance seems to be introduced by what went before
it, and in which all the adjoining parts seem to have some
natural relation to one another, is more agreeable than a
disjointed and disorderly assemblage of unconnected objects.
But. . . .I go along with Bufﬁer’s ingenious theory to this
extent:
it hardly ever happens that a particular thing’s
external form is so beautiful that it gives pleasure although

106

Smith on Moral Sentiments

Custom and moral sentiments

it is quite contrary to custom and unlike anything we have
been used to in that species of things; or so ugly as to be
disagreeable although custom uniformly supports it and gets
us used to seeing it in every single individual of the kind.

Chapter 2: The inﬂuence of custom and fashion on
moral sentiments

Our sentiments concerning every kind of beauty are so much
inﬂuenced by •custom and fashion that •those forces are
bound to have some inﬂuence on our sentiments concerning
the beauty of conduct. But their inﬂuence in this domain
seems to be much less than it is everywhere else. It may
be that custom can reconcile us to any form of external
objects, however absurd and fantastical; but no custom will
ever reconcile us to the characters and conduct of a Nero
or a Claudius—one will always be an object of dread and
hatred, the other of scorn and derision. The mechanisms
of the imagination, on which our sense of beauty depends,
are delicately ﬁne-tuned and can easily be altered by habit
and education; but our sentiments of moral approval and
disapproval are based on the strongest and most vigorous
passions of human nature; and though they may be some-
what warped ·by custom and fashion·, they can’t be entirely
perverted.

However, the inﬂuence of custom and fashion on moral
sentiments is •similar in kind to their inﬂuence everywhere
else;
it is merely •different in strength. When custom
and fashion coincide with the natural principles of right
and wrong, they heighten the delicacy of our sentiments
[Smith’s words] and increase our loathing for everything that
approximates to evil. Someone who has been brought up
in really good company—not what is commonly called ‘good
company’—will have become used to seeing in the people

he lived with nothing but justice, modesty, humaneness,
and good order. Because of his upbringing, he will be more
shocked ·than the rest of us are· by anything that seems to
be inconsistent with the rules that those virtues of modesty
etc. prescribe. And someone who has had the misfortune
to be brought up amidst violence, licentiousness, falsehood,
and injustice may still have some sense of the impropriety
of such conduct, but he won’t have any all sense of how
dreadful it is, or of the vengeance and punishment that it
deserves. He has been familiarized with it from his infancy,
custom has made it habitual to him, and he’s apt to regard it
as ‘the way of the world’, as it is called—something that may,
or even something that should, be practised so as to stop us
from being the dupes of our own integrity [Smith’s wording].

[Smith says that a certain degree of disorder can he
liked because it is fashionable, and that fashion can lead
to people’s disliking qualities that deserve to be respected.
He cites the reign of Charles II as a time when a degree of
licentiousness was connected in people’s minds with various
virtues, and was taken to show that the licentious person
‘was a gentleman, not a puritan’. He describes with colourful
indignation the upside-down morality that arises from this
kind of fashion. Then:]

Men in different professions and states of life naturally
come to have different characters and manners, because of
differences in the kinds of objects they have been used to
and the passions that they have formed. We expect each
man to behave somewhat in the way that experience has
taught us belong to his rank or profession;. . . .and we’ll be
especially pleased if he has neither too much nor too little
of the character that usually accompanies his particular
‘species’ (if I may use the word in that way). A man, we
say, should look like his trade and profession; but the
pedantry [= ‘excessive attention to correctness of details’] of every

107

Smith on Moral Sentiments

Custom and moral sentiments

profession is disagreeable. The different periods of life have
different manners assigned to them, for the same reason. We
expect in old age the gravity and calm that its inﬁrmities, its
long experience, and its worn-out sensibility seem to make
natural and respectworthy; and we expect to ﬁnd in youth
the sensibility, gaiety and sprightly vivacity that experience
teaches us to expect from the lively impressions that objects
are apt to make on the unpractised senses of the young.
But each of those two ages can easily have too much of
its special features. The ﬂirting levity of youth, and the
immovable insensibility of old age, are equally disagreeable.
The young (as the saying goes) are most agreeable when their
behaviour has something of the manners of the old, and the
old are most agreeable when they retain something of the
gaiety of the young. But either of them could go too far: the
extreme coldness and dull formality that are pardoned in
old age make youth ridiculous; and the levity, carelessness,
and vanity that are permitted to the young make old age
contemptible.

The special character and manners that custom leads us
to associate with a given rank or profession may sometimes
have a propriety independent of custom; they are the charac-
ter and manners that we would approve of for their own sakes
if we took into consideration all the different circumstances
that naturally affect those in each ‘species’. [Smith goes on
about this, with some ‘very obvious’ reﬂections, such as: our
approval of someone’s passion regarding something depends
in part on what else the person’s situation involves. We don’t
blame a mother who expresses, over the death of her soldier
son, a level of grief that would be inexcusable in a general
at the head of an army, who has so much else on his plate.
We disapprove of levity or casualness in the manner of a
preacher ‘whose special occupation it is to •keep the world
in mind of the awe-inspiring after-life that awaits them, and

to •announce what may be the fatal consequences of every
deviation from the rules of duty’.]

The basis for the customary character of some other
professions is not so obvious, and our approval of it is
based entirely on habit, without being conﬁrmed or enlivened
by any thoughts of the kind I have been discussing. For
example, custom leads us to associate the character of gaiety,
levity, and sprightly freedom, as well as of some degree of
dissipation, to the military profession. But if we thought
about what mood or tone of temper would be most suitable
to a soldier’s situation, we would be apt to conclude that
a serious and thoughtful cast of mind would be the most
appropriate for men whose lives are continually exposed
to uncommon danger.
[Smith develops this thought, and
suggests that the levity of serving soldiers may be their
way of coping with their dangerous situation, ‘losing their
anxiety’ about it. He offers evidence for that hypothesis:]
Whenever an ofﬁcer has no reason to think he is faced with
any uncommon danger, he is apt to lose the gaiety and
dissipated thoughtlessness of his character. The captain of a
city guard is usually as sober, careful, and penny-pinching
as the rest of his fellow-citizens!. . . .

The different situations of different times and countries
are apt to give different characters to the general run of
people who live in them; and their sentiments regarding
what degree of this or that quality is either blameworthy or
praiseworthy vary according to the degree that is usually
blamed or praised in their own country at their own time.
A degree of politeness that would be regarded as rude and
barbaric at the court of France might be highly esteemed in
Russia—unless it was condemned there as effeminate! The
degree of order and frugality that would be regarded in a
Polish nobleman as •excessive parsimony would be regarded
as •extravagance in a citizen of Amsterdam. . . .

108

Smith on Moral Sentiments

Custom and moral sentiments

Among civilized nations, the virtues that are based on
humaneness are cultivated more than the ones based on self-
denial and the command of the passions. Among rude and
barbarous nations it is quite otherwise: in them the virtues
of self-denial are more cultivated than those of humaneness.
The general security and happiness that prevail at times of
civic-mindedness and highly developed society don’t call for
contempt of danger, or patience in enduring labour, hunger,
and pain. Because poverty can easily be avoided, disregard
for it almost ceases to be a virtue. . . .

Among savages and barbarians it is quite otherwise.
[Smith now launches on three harrowing pages about how
‘savages and barbarians’—he mentions in particular ‘the
savages in North America’—have a value-system that is
shaped by the hardships and necessities of their situation.
One example: arranged marriages; sexual activity between
spouses conducted in secret; no expressions of affection.
Then the main example: a régime of discipline to enable any
young savage to be able to preserve calm equanimity under
threat of death and during horrible tortures (Smith gives
details). The closing passage on this theme is notable. [In it,
‘magnanimity’ means ‘courage and calmness in the face of danger’. The
second occurrence of ‘contempt’ means what we mean by the word, but
the ﬁrst occurrence means ‘disregard’ or ‘refusal to treat as important’.
The passage is an explosion of Smith’s rage at the thought of savage
‘heroes’ being ill-treated by slave-traders (and their hirelings) who are
garbage from the jails.] Smith continues:] The same contempt
for death and torture prevails in all the other savage nations.
There’s not a negro from the coast of Africa who doesn’t
in this respect have a degree of magnanimity that the soul
of his sordid master is too often hardly able to conceive of.
Fortune never used her dominance of mankind more cruelly
than when she subjected those nations of heroes to the
sweepings of the jails of Europe, to wretches who don’t have

the virtues of the countries they come from or of the ones
they go to—wretches whose levity, brutality, and baseness so
deservedly expose them to the contempt of the vanquished.
This heroic and unconquerable ﬁrmness. . . .is not re-
quired from those who are brought up to live in civilized
If they complain when they are in pain, grieve
societies.
when they are in distress, allow themselves to be overcome
by love or rufﬂed by anger, they are easily pardoned. Such
weaknesses are not seen as affecting the essential parts of
their character. As long as they don’t do anything contrary to
justice or humaneness, they lose little reputation, even if the
serenity of their countenance or the calmness of their dis-
course and behaviour is somewhat disturbed. A humane and
polished people, who have more sensitivity to the passions
of others, can more easily sympathize with animated and
passionate behaviour, and can more easily pardon any slight
excess of it. The person principally concerned is aware of
this,. . . .and is accordingly less afraid of exposing himself to
others’ contempt by the violence of his emotions. [Smith goes
on about differences in conversational style between civilised
people and barbarians, and also about how some European
nations differ in this respect, the French and Italians being
much more lively than people with ‘duller sensibility’ such as
the English. He reports one writer who said that ‘an Italian
expresses more emotion on being sentenced to a ﬁne of
twenty shillings than an Englishman on receiving a sentence
of death’. (Smith seems to have an ascending scale of polish
and civilisedness, and a corresponding scale of increasingly
expressive and emotional ways of talking and behaving; with
‘savages’ at the bottom of each scale, the French and Italians
at the top, and the English somewhere in between.) He
follows this up with examples from ancient Rome. Then:]

This difference gives rise to many others that are equally
essential ·as national characteristics·. A polished people,

109

Smith on Moral Sentiments

Custom and moral sentiments

being accustomed to giving way somewhat to their natural
feelings, become frank, open, and sincere. Whereas barbar-
ians, being obliged to smother and conceal the appearance of
every passion, inevitably acquire the habits of falsehood and
pretence. Everyone who has had any dealings with savage
nations—whether in Asia, Africa, or America—has found
them equally impenetrable, ﬁnding that when they want to
conceal the truth there’s no way of getting it out of them.
They can’t be tricked by artful questions, and not even tor-
ture can get them to tell anything that they don’t want to tell.
But the passions of a savage, though never expressed by any
outward emotional display and always hidden in the person’s
breast, rise to the highest pitch of fury. Though the savage
seldom shows any symptoms of anger, his vengeance—when
he gets to it—is always bloody and dreadful. The least insult
drives him to despair. His countenance and discourse remain
sober and calm, expressing nothing but the most perfect
tranquillity of mind; but his actions are often furious and
violent. Among the North-Americans it is not uncommon
for girls to drown themselves after receiving only a slight
reprimand from their mothers, doing this without expressing
any passion or indeed saying anything except ‘You shall no
longer have a daughter’. In civilized nations the passions of
men are not usually so furious or so desperate. They are
often noisy, but are seldom very harmful; and they seem
often to have no purpose except to convince the spectator
that they are in the right to be so much moved, thereby
getting his sympathy and approval.

All these effects of custom and fashion on the moral
sentiments of mankind are minor in comparison to some of
their other effects. Where custom and fashion produce the
greatest perversion of judgment is not in connection with the
•general style of character and behaviour (·which is what I
have been discussing·) but in connection with the propriety

or impropriety of •particular usages.

The different manners that custom teaches us to approve
of in the different professions and states of life don’t concern
things of the greatest importance. We expect truth and
justice from an old man as well as from a young, from
a clergyman as well as from an ofﬁcer; and it’s only in
minor matters that we look for the distinguishing marks
of their respective characters [meaning: the characteristics that
are typical of them as old, as young, as clergyman, as ofﬁcer]. Also, the
character that custom has taught us to ascribe to a given
profession may be proper, independently of custom, because
of details that we haven’t noticed. So these matters don’t
involve any large perversion of natural sentiment. What
the manners of different nations require in a character that
they think worthy of esteem are different degrees of the
same quality, ·but there’s nothing bad about that·. The
worst that it can be said to involve is that the duties of
•one virtue are sometimes extended so as to encroach a
little on the territory of •some other. The rustic hospitality
that is in fashion among the Poles may perhaps encroach a
little on economy and good order; and the frugality that is
esteemed in Holland may encroach on generosity and good-
fellowship. The hardiness demanded of savages diminishes
their humaneness; and the delicate sensitivity required in
civilized nations may sometimes destroy masculine ﬁrmness
of character. But the style of manners that obtains in any
nation is often, on the whole, the one that is most suitable to
its situation. Hardiness is the character most suitable to the
circumstances of a savage; sensitivity to the circumstances
of life in a very civilized society. So even in this area we can’t
complain that men’s moral sentiments are grossly perverted.
Thus, where custom authorises the widest departure from
the natural propriety of action is not in the general style of
conduct or behaviour, but in regard to particular practices.

110

Smith on Moral Sentiments

Custom and moral sentiments

That is where custom’s inﬂuence is often much more destruc-
tive of good morals. It can establish, as ·supposedly· lawful
and blameless, particular actions that shock the plainest
principles of right and wrong. ·I shall give just one example
of this·.

Can there be greater barbarity than to harm an infant?
Its helplessness, its innocence, its likeableness, call forth
the compassion even of an enemy; not to spare that tender
age is regarded as the most furious effort of an enraged and
cruel conqueror. Well, then, what can be the heart of a
•parent who could injure a weakness that even a •furious
enemy is afraid to violate? Yet the murder of new-born
infants was a permitted practice in almost all the states
of ·ancient· Greece, even among the polished and civilized
Athenians; and whenever the circumstances of the parent
made it inconvenient [here = ‘difﬁcult and burdensome’] to bring
up the child, it could be abandoned to hunger or to wild
beasts without attracting blame or censure. This practice
probably began in times of the most savage barbarism: men’s
imaginations were ﬁrst made familiar with it in that earliest
period of society, and the unbroken continuity of the custom
hindered them from later seeing how abominable it is. Even
today we ﬁnd that this practice prevails among all savage
nations; and in that roughest and lowest state of society it
is undoubtedly more excusable than in any other. A savage
can have such a lack of food that it isn’t possible for him
to support both himself and his child; so it’s not surprising

that in this case he abandons it. . . .
In the latter ages of
·ancient· Greece, however, the same thing—·leaving babies
out in the wilds, to starve or be eaten by wild animals·—was
permitted on the grounds of minor interest or convenience
which could by no means excuse it. Uninterrupted custom
had by this time so thoroughly authorised the practice that it
was tolerated not only •by the loose maxims of the world but
even •by the doctrines of philosophers, which ought to have
been more just and precise. . . . Aristotle talks of it as though
he thought that the authorities ought often to encourage it.
The humane Plato is of the same opinion, and—despite all the
love of mankind that seems to animate all his writings—he
never expresses disapproval of this practice. When custom
can give sanction to such a dreadful violation of humanity,
we can well imagine that hardly any particular practice is
so gross that custom couldn’t authorise it. We constantly
hear men saying ‘It’s commonly done’, apparently thinking
that this a sufﬁcient excuse for something that is in itself
the most unjust and unreasonable conduct.

There’s an obvious reason why custom never perverts our
sentiments with regard to •the general style and character of
behaviour in the same degree as it does with regard to •the
propriety or unlawfulness of particular practices. It’s that
there never can be any such custom! No society could survive
for a moment if in it the usual strain of men’s behaviour was
of a piece with the horrible practice I have been discussing.

When we consider the character of any individual, we naturally view it under two different aspects: •as it may affect his own
happiness (the topic of Section 1) and •as it may affect that of other people (the topic of Section 2).

Section 1: Prudence, i.e. the character of the individual in its bearing on his own happiness

What Nature ﬁrst recommends to the care of every indi-
vidual, it seems, is the preservation and healthful state of
his body. The appetites of hunger and thirst, the agreeable
or disagreeable sensations of pleasure and pain, of heat and
cold, etc. can be considered as lessons given by Nature in
her own voice, telling him what he ought to choose for this
purpose and what he ought to avoid. The ﬁrst lessons he
learns from those who care for him in his childhood are
mostly aimed the same way: their main purpose is to teach
him how to keep out of harm’s way.

As he grows up, he soon learns that some care and
foresight are needed if he is to satisfy those natural appetites,
to procure pleasure and avoid pain, to procure agreeable
temperatures and avoid disagreeable heat and cold. The
art of preserving and increasing what is called his external
fortune consists in the proper direction of this care and
foresight.
[To increase one’s ‘external fortune’ is to become more
prosperous (in money, property, land etc.). There is an ‘art’ of doing this,
in Smith’s sense, simply because doing it requires skill in the mastery of
techniques.]

The basic advantage of external fortune is that it enables
one to provide the necessities and conveniences of the body,
but we can’t live long in the world without noticing that the
respect of our equals, our credit and rank in the society we
live in, depend very much on how large an external fortune

we possess, or are supposed to possess. The wish to become
proper objects of this respect, to deserve and obtain this
credit and rank among our equals, may be the strongest of
all our desires; so that our anxiety to obtain the advantages
of fortune is stimulated much more by this desire than by
the desire to supply all the necessities and conveniences of
the body—a desire that is always easily satisﬁed.

Our rank and credit among our equals also depends
heavily on something that a virtuous man might wish to
be the sole source of them, namely our •character and
•conduct, or on the conﬁdence, esteem, and good-will that
•these naturally arouse in the people we live with.

The care of the health, the fortune, and the rank and rep-
utation of the individual—these being the items on which his
comfort and happiness in this life are supposed principally
to depend—is regarded as the proper business of the virtue
commonly called ‘prudence’.

I have already pointed out that our suffering when we
fall from a better to a worse situation is greater than any
enjoyment we get in rising from a worse to a better. For
that reason, the ﬁrst and the principal object of prudence
is security. Prudence is opposed to our exposing our health,
our fortune, our rank, or our reputation to any sort of risk.
It is cautious rather than enterprising, and more concerned
to preserve the advantages that we already possess than

112

Smith on Moral Sentiments

Custom and moral sentiments

to prompt us to the acquisition of still greater advantages.
The methods of improving our fortune that it principally
recommends to us are the ones that don’t involve risk: real
knowledge and skill in our trade or profession, hard work
and persistence in the exercise of it, frugality to the point of
parsimony in all our expenses.

The prudent man always makes a serious point of actually
understanding whatever he professes to understand, not
merely trying persuade other people that he understands
it; and though his talents may not always be brilliant they
are always perfectly genuine. [Note the connection between what
he professes to understand and his profession.] He doesn’t try to
impose on you by

the cunning tricks of an artful impostor,
the arrogant airs of a pretentious pedant, or
the conﬁdent assertions of a rash and superﬁcial
pretender.

He doesn’t make a great show even of the abilities that he
really does have. His conversation is simple and modest,
and he dislikes all the quackish [Smith’s word] arts by which
other people so often thrust themselves into public notice
and reputation. For reputation in his profession he is
naturally inclined to rely a good deal on the solidity of his
knowledge and abilities; and he doesn’t always think of trying
to please the little clubs and gangs who, in the superior arts
and sciences, set themselves up as the supreme judges
of merit, and celebrate one another’s talents and virtues
while decrying anything that can come into competition with
them. . . .

The prudent man is always sincere. He hates the thought
of exposing himself to the disgrace that comes from the
detection of falsehood. But though always sincere, he isn’t
always frank and open; he never says anything that isn’t
true, but he doesn’t always think he is obliged to volunteer

the whole truth. To match his cautious way of •acting, he
is reserved in his •speech, and never forces on people his
opinions about anything or anyone.

[The prudent man is always capable of friendship, Smith
says, but his friendship (with a few chosen people) is solid
and durable rather than ardent and passionate. He doesn’t
go in for socializing, because parties and such would interfere
too much with his chosen way of life. Also:]

Though his conversation isn’t always very sprightly or
diverting, it is always perfectly inoffensive. The prudent
man hates the thought of being guilty of any petulance or
rudeness. . . . In both conduct and conversation he strictly
preserves decency and is almost religiously scrupulous in
maintaining all the established decorums and ceremonials
of society. In this respect he sets a much better example
than was set, down through the centuries, by many men
with much more splendid talents and virtues than his—from
Socrates and Aristippus down to Swift and Voltaire, and from
Philip of Macedon and Alexander the Great down to Peter the
Great of Russia. These men have too often stood out because
of their improper and even insolent contempt for all the
ordinary decorums of life and conversation, setting a most
pernicious example to anyone wanting to resemble them—
followers who too often content themselves with imitating
their follies, without even trying to attain their perfections.
The prudent man keeps at his work, and is always frugal,
thereby sacriﬁcing the ease and enjoyment of the present
moment for the probable expectation of greater ease and
enjoyment later on and for a longer time; and in this con-
duct he is always supported and rewarded by the complete
approval of the impartial spectator, and of that spectator’s
representative, the man within the breast. The impartial
spectator doesn’t feel himself worn out by the present work
of the people whose conduct he surveys; nor does he feel

113

Smith on Moral Sentiments

Custom and moral sentiments

himself pulled by the loud and persistent demands of their
present appetites. To him the •present situation ·of those
people· is nearly the same as •their likely future situation.
He sees •them from nearly the same distance and is affected
by them in nearly in the same manner. But he knows that to
the people principally concerned—·the ones whose present
and future situations are in question·—they’re far from being
the same, and naturally affect them differently. So he can’t
help approving—even applauding—the proper exercise of
self-control that enables them to act as if their present and
their future situation affected •them in nearly the same way
that they affect •him.

[Smith now has a paragraph concerning the prudent
man’s attitude to wealth. He is ‘naturally contented with
his situation’ because he lives within his income. As he
gradually becomes wealthier, he can gradually relax his
frugality, enjoying modest luxuries both for themselves and
for their contrast with his previous way of life. He doesn’t
rush, unprepared, into any new enterprises. Also:]

The prudent man isn’t willing to undertake any responsi-

bility that his duty does not impose on him. He

•doesn’t bustle in matters where he has no concern;
•doesn’t meddle in other people’s affairs;
•doesn’t set himself up as a counsellor or adviser,
pushing his advice at people who haven’t asked for it.
. . . .He is averse to taking sides in any party disputes, hates
faction, and isn’t always attentive to the voice of ambition—
even of noble and great ambition. He won’t refuse to serve
his country when clearly called on to do so, but he won’t
scheme and plot in order to force himself into such service;
he would prefer public business to be well managed by
someone else. . . .

In short, when prudence aims merely at taking care
of the individual person’s health, fortune, and rank and

reputation, though it’s regarded as a most respectworthy
and even somewhat likeable and agreeable quality, it is
never regarded as one the most endearing or ennobling of
the virtues. It commands a certain cold esteem, but seems
not to be entitled to any ardent love or admiration.

We often label as ‘prudence’ wise and judicious conduct
that is directed to greater and nobler purposes than the
care of the health, the fortune, the rank and reputation
of the individual. This is a legitimate usage. We talk of
the ‘prudence’ of a great general, a great statesman, a great
legislator. In all these cases prudence is combined with many
greater and more splendid virtues—valour, extensive and
strong benevolence, a sacred regard for the rules of justice,
and all these supported by a proper degree of self-control.
For this superior ·kind of· prudence to reach the highest
degree of perfection it has to involve the art, the talent,
and the habit or disposition of acting with the most perfect
propriety in every possible situation. [Remember that for Smith
‘propriety’ means rightness in a strong moral sense.] It has to involve
the utmost perfection of all the •intellectual and of all the
•moral virtues—the best head joined to the best heart, perfect
wisdom combined with perfect virtue. [Smith adds that this
superior public kind of virtue approximates to the character
of a ‘sage’ according to Aristotle, and that the inferior private
kind of virtue approximates to the character of a ‘sage’
according to the Epicureans.]

Mere imprudence—the mere inability to take care of
oneself—is pitied by generous and humane people. People
with less delicate feelings treat imprudence with •neglect or,
at worst, •contempt, but never with •hatred or •indignation.
Whereas the infamy and disgrace that accompany other vices
are enormously intensiﬁed when those vices are combined
with imprudence. The rogue whose skill enables him to
escape detection and punishment (though not to escape

114

Smith on Moral Sentiments

Custom and moral sentiments

strong suspicion) is too often received in the world with
a permissiveness that he doesn’t deserve. The awkward
and foolish rogue whose lack of skill leads to his being
convicted and punished is an object of universal hatred,
contempt, and derision.
In countries where great crimes
often go unpunished, really atrocious actions become almost
familiar, and stop impressing the people with the kind of
horror that everyone feels in countries where the adminis-
tration of justice is properly carried out. The injustice is
the same in both countries, but the level of imprudence
may be different. In countries of the latter kind—·the ones
with good justice systems·—great crimes are obviously great
follies.
In countries of the other kind they aren’t always
seen in that way.
In Italy, during most of the sixteenth
century, assassinations and murders. . . .seem to have been
almost familiar among the upper classes. Cesare Borgia
invited four of the little princes in his neighbourhood—all
with little kingdoms and their own little armies—to a friendly

conference in Senigaglia; and as soon as they arrived there he
put them all to death. Although this dreadful action wasn’t
approved of, even in that age of crimes, it doesn’t seem to
have contributed much to the discredit of the perpetrator,
and contributed nothing towards his ruin. . . . The violence
and injustice of •great conquerors are often regarded with
foolish wonder and admiration; the violence and injustice of
•minor thieves, robbers, and murderers are always regarded
with contempt, hatred and even horror. . . . The injustice
of the •former is certainly at least as great as that of the
•latter, but their folly and imprudence are nowhere near as
great. A wicked and worthless man who is clever and skillful
often goes through the world with much more credit than he
deserves. A wicked and worthless fool always appears to be
the most hateful, as well as the most contemptible, of mortals.
Just as prudence combined with other virtues constitutes
the noblest of all characters, imprudence combined with
other vices constitutes the vilest.

Section 2: The character of the individual in its bearing on the happiness of other people

Introduction

The character of any individual can affect the happiness
of other people only through its disposition either to harm
them or to beneﬁt them.

The •only motive that the impartial spectator can justify
for our harming or in any way disturbing the happiness of
our neighbour is •proper resentment for injustice attempted
or actually committed. To harm someone from any other
motive is itself a violation of the laws of justice—the sort

of thing that should be restrained or punished by force.
The wisdom of every state or commonwealth does its best
to use the force of the society to restrain its subjects from
harming or disturbing one another’s happiness. The rules it
establishes for this purpose constitute the civil and criminal
law of that state or country. The principles on which those
rules are—or ought to be—based are the subject of one
particular science, by far the •most important of all the
sciences though until now perhaps the •least cultivated. I

115

Smith on Moral Sentiments

Who should have our care and attention

am talking about the science of natural jurisprudence. My
present topic doesn’t require me to go into this in any detail.
A sacred and religious regard not to harm or disturb our
neighbour’s happiness in any way, even over something
for which no law can properly protect him, constitutes the
character of the perfectly innocent and just man. [Smith uses
‘sacred’ (often) and ‘religious’ (occasionally) with no religious meaning, as
we have just seen him do. His topic is simply strict, scrupulous, careful
obedience to a rule. On page 89 he said that for anyone who thinks
that the rule is a law of God, it acquires a ‘new sacredness’.] Whenever
someone has this character to the point of being really careful
not to harm or disturb his neighbour, the character is highly
respectworthy and even venerable for its own sake, and
is nearly always accompanied by many other virtues, with
great feeling for other people, humaneness, and benevolence.
We all understand this character well enough; it needn’t be
further explained by me. All I’m going to attempt in the
present section is to explain the basis for the order that
Nature seems to have marked out for the direction and
employment of our limited powers of beneﬁcence—towards
individuals (Chapter 1) and towards societies (Chapter 2).
[Smith often uses ‘order’ to mean ‘organisation’ etc., but his present topic
is the down-to-earth sense of ‘order’ that concerns who or what comes
ﬁrst, second etc. in the queue.]

It will turn out that the same unerring wisdom that
regulates every other part of Nature’s conduct also governs
the ordering of her recommendations that we attend to
potential beneﬁciaries. The more a particular benefaction is
needed, the more useful it can be, the stronger is Nature’s
recommendation that we make it.

116

Chapter 1: The order in which individuals are rec-
ommended by nature to our care and attention

Every man, as the Stoics used to say, is ﬁrst and principally
recommended ·by Nature· to care for himself; and every
man is indeed in every way ﬁtter and abler to take care
of himself than to take care of anyone else. Every man
feels •his own pleasures and his own pains more intensely
[Smith says ‘sensibly’] than •those of other people, feels •the
original sensations more intensely than •the reﬂected or
sympathetic images of those sensations, feels •the substance
more intensely than •the shadow.

(1) After himself, the members of his own family—his
parents, his children, his brothers and sisters—are naturally
the objects of his warmest affections. They are naturally
the persons on whose happiness or misery his conduct
must have the greatest inﬂuence. He is more accustomed
to sympathizing with them, he knows better how everything
is likely to affect them, and he can have a more precise and
deﬁnite sympathy with them than he can have with most
other people. In short, what he feels for •them is a close
approximation to what he feels for •himself.

This sympathy and the affections based on it are naturally
directed more strongly towards his children than towards his
parents, and his tenderness for the children seems generally
to be more active than his reverence and gratitude towards
his parents. In the natural state of things the child, for some
time after it comes into the world, depends for its survival
entirely on the care of the parent, whereas the parent’s
survival doesn’t naturally depend on the care of the child. In
nature’s way of looking at things, a child seems to be a more
important object than an old man; and it arouses a much
livelier and much more universal sympathy. It ought to do
so. Everything can be expected or at least hoped for from

Smith on Moral Sentiments

Who should have our care and attention

the child, whereas ordinarily little can be expected or hoped
for from the old man. [Smith was 36 years old when he wrote this.]
The weakness of childhood draws the affections of ·even· the
most brutal and hard-hearted, but the inﬁrmities of old age
are objects of contempt and aversion for everyone who isn’t
virtuous and humane. Ordinarily an old man dies without
being much regretted by anyone, but it’s not often that a
child can die without breaking someone’s heart.

The earliest friendships—the ones that are naturally
formed when the heart is most liable to that feeling—are the
friendships among brothers and sisters. While they are still
living together their being on good terms with one another
is necessary for the household’s tranquillity and happiness.
They can give more pleasure or pain to one another than
to most other people. Their situation ·as siblings living
together· makes their mutual sympathy utterly important
to their common happiness; and by the wisdom of nature
that same situation, by obliging them to accommodate to
one another, makes that sympathy more habitual and thus
more lively, sharp and deﬁnite.

[The same holds for •cousins, though less strongly, Smith
says. The friendship among siblings is enhanced if their
offspring are also on good terms, but the sympathy between
cousins is less necessary than between siblings, and ‘so it
is less habitual and therefore correspondingly weaker’. Be-
tween the •children of cousins etc. ‘the affection diminishes
as the relation grows more remote’.]

What is called ‘affection’ is really nothing but habitual
sympathy. Our concern for the objects of our ‘affections’—
our desire to promote their happiness or prevent their
misery—is either the actual feeling of that habitual sympathy
or a necessary consequences of it. Relatives are usually
placed in situations that naturally create this habitual
sympathy, so a suitable degree of affection is expected to

hold among them. We generally ﬁnd that it does indeed
hold;. . . .and we’re shocked whenever we ﬁnd that it doesn’t.
The established general rule says that persons related to one
another in a certain degree ought always to have mutual
affections of a certain kind, and whenever they don’t there
is the highest impropriety, and sometimes even a sort of
impiety. A parent without parental tenderness, a child devoid
of all ﬁlial reverence, appear to be monsters—objects not only
of hatred but of horror.

Sometimes the circumstances that usually produce those
‘natural affections’ happen not to have existed; but even in
those cases the general rule will often make up for that to
some extent, producing something that at least is like those
affections. A father is apt to be less attached to a child who
for some reason was separated from him in its infancy and
returns to him only as an adult. The father is apt to feel less
paternal tenderness for the child, and the child less ﬁlial
reverence for the father. When siblings are brought up in
distant countries they are apt to feel a similar lessening of
affection; but if they are dutiful and virtuous, their respect
for the general rule will often produce, again, something that
at least is like those natural affections. Even during their
separation, the father and the child, the brothers and the
sisters, are by no means indifferent to one another. They
consider one another as persons to and from whom certain
affections are due, and they hope some day to be in a position
to enjoy the friendship that ought naturally to have taken
place among such close relatives. Until they meet, the absent
son or brother is often the favourite son or brother. He has
never offended, or he offended so long ago that the offence
is forgotten—a childish prank not worth remembering. . . .
When they meet, it is often with a strong disposition to have
the habitual sympathy that constitutes family affection—so
strong that they’re apt •to imagine they actually have that

117

Smith on Moral Sentiments

Who should have our care and attention

sympathy and •to behave to one another as if they had. But
I’m afraid that in many cases time and experience undeceive
them. On coming to know one another better, they often turn
out to have habits, moods, and inclinations that are different
from what the others expected; and they can’t easily adjust
to these because of the lack of the habitual sympathy that
is the basis and driving force of ‘family affection’ properly
so-called. . . .

Anyway, it is only with dutiful and virtuous people that
the general rule has even this slender authority. People
who are dissipated, proﬂigate or vain will disregard the rule
entirely. They will be so far from respecting it that they’ll
seldom talk of it except with indecent derision; and an early
and long separation of this kind always completely estranges
them from one another. With such persons, respect for the
general rule can at best produce only a cold and affected
civility (a faint copy of real regard), and even this is commonly
abolished by a slight offence, a tiny conﬂict of interests.

The education of boys at distant great schools, of young
men at distant colleges, of young ladies in distant nunneries
and boarding-schools, seems in the higher ranks of society
to have done crucial harm to domestic morals and thus to
domestic happiness, both in France and in England. Do you
want to bring up your children to be dutiful to their parents,
kind and affectionate to their brothers and sisters? Then
bring them up in your own home—make it necessary for
them to be dutiful children, kind and affectionate brothers
and sisters! From their parents’ house the children may, with
propriety and advantage, go out every day to attend public
schools; but let them continue to live at home. That way of
bringing up a child is the institution of nature; education
away from home at a boarding school is a contrivance of
man. You don’t need me to tell you which is likely to be
wiser!

[Smith’s next three paragraphs make these points: •In
‘tragedies and romances’ we meet stories about people who
are drawn to one another because they are blood-related,
though they don’t know that they are; but this never happens
in real life. •In ‘countries where the authority of law is not
alone sufﬁcient to give perfect security to everyone’, the
different branches of a growing extended family often choose
to live close to one another; and that gives any two of them a
weakened version of the kind of connection most of us have
with members of our more immediate family. •In countries
where the authority of law is enough to protect everyone, as
families grow they spread and scatter, and the parts of them
stop mattering to one another.]

I regard natural affection (as they call it) as an effect
of the moral connection between the parent and the child
more than of the supposed physical connection. [The ‘moral
·But
connection’ is the fact that the parent and child live together.]
sometimes a belief about physical connection outweighs the
actual facts about moral connection·. A jealous husband,
despite the moral connection—despite the child’s having
been brought up in his own house—often hates the unhappy
child whom he supposes to be the offspring of his wife’s
inﬁdelity. . . .

Among well-disposed people who need ·in their occupa-
tions· to accommodate themselves to one another there often
comes to be a friendship not unlike what holds between those
who are born to live in the same household. Colleagues in
ofﬁce, partners in trade, call one another ‘brothers’, and
often feel towards one another as if they really were so. . . .

Even the trivial fact of living in the same neighbourhood
has some effect of the same kind. We respect the face of a
man whom we see every day, provided he has never offended
us. Neighbours can be convenient to one another, and they
can also be troublesome. If they are a good sort of people

118

Smith on Moral Sentiments

Who should have our care and attention

they are naturally disposed to agree. . . . So there are certain
small favours that everyone agrees are due to a neighbour in
preference to anyone who has no such connection.

This natural disposition to do our best to make our own
sentiments, principles, and feelings ﬁt with the sentiments
etc. that we see ﬁxed and rooted in persons whom we
are obliged to live and converse with is the cause of the
contagious effects of both good and bad company. A man
who associates chieﬂy with the wise and the virtuous, though
he may not become either wise or virtuous himself, can’t help
acquiring at least a certain respect for wisdom and virtue;
and one who associates chieﬂy with proﬂigate and dissolute
people, though he may not become proﬂigate and dissolute
himself, must soon at least lose all his original loathing of
proﬂigacy and dissoluteness. This same disposition may
contribute something to the similarity of family characters
that we often see transmitted through several generations;
but the family character seems not to come only from
the moral connection but also in part from the physical
connection—which is of course the sole cause of the family
face.

(2) But by far the most respectworthy of all attachments
to an individual is the one that is wholly based on respect
and approval of what he does and how he does it, conﬁrmed
by much experience and long acquaintance. The sympathy
that underlies such friendships isn’t •constrained—it isn’t
a sympathy that has been assumed and made habitual for
the sake of convenience and getting along together. It is a
•natural sympathy that comes from an involuntary feeling
that the persons we choose as friends are natural and
proper objects of respect and approval. Such friendship
is possible only between men of virtue. Only they can feel
the entire conﬁdence in one another’s conduct that gives
them a guarantee that they will never offend or be offended

by one another. Vice is always capricious; it’s only virtue that
is regular and orderly. The attachment that is based on the
love of virtue is the •happiest of all attachments as well as
the most •permanent and secure. Such friendships needn’t
be conﬁned to a single person; they can safely include all
the wise and virtuous people whose wisdom and virtue we
can wholly depend on because we have seen them from close
up for a long period of time. Those who want to conﬁne
friendship to two persons seem to be confusing •the wise
security of friendship with •the jealousy and folly of love. The
hasty and foolish intimacies of young people are often based
on

•some slight similarity of character, quite unconnected
with good conduct, on
•a taste for the same studies, the same amusements,
the same diversions, or on
•their sharing some special opinion that isn’t widely
held.

These intimacies that begin from a whim and are ended by
another whim, however agreeable they may appear while
they last, come nowhere near to deserving the sacred and
venerable name of ‘friendship’.

(3) Of all the persons whom nature points out for our spe-
cial beneﬁcence, however, there are none to whom it seems
more properly directed than those who have already been
our benefactors. Nature, which formed men for a mutual
kindness that is necessary for their happiness, makes every
man the special object of the kindness of people to whom
he himself has been kind. Even when the beneﬁciaries’
gratitude doesn’t correspond to what their benefactor has
done for them, the sense of his merit—the sympathetic
gratitude of the impartial spectator—will always correspond
to it. And sometimes the general sense of someone’s merit
can be increased by people’s indignation over the ingratitude

119

Smith on Moral Sentiments

Which societies should receive our beneﬁcence

of his beneﬁciaries. No benevolent man ever lost altogether
the fruits of his benevolence.
If he doesn’t always gather
them from the persons from whom they ought to have come,
he nearly always gathers them, and with a tenfold increase,
from other people. Kindness is the parent of kindness; and
if the great object of our ambition is to be beloved by our
brethren, the surest way of obtaining it is to show by our
conduct that we really love them.

After the persons who are recommended to our benef-
icence by (1) their connection with ourselves, by (2) their
personal qualities, or by (3) their past services, come (4)
those whom nature points out to us not for •friendship with
us but for •our benevolent attention. What picks these people
out is ·not any special intrinsic qualities that they have, but·
their special situation: they are •greatly fortunate or •greatly
unfortunate—•rich and powerful •or poor and wretched. [In
what follows, the phrases ‘the distinction of ranks’ and ‘the peace and
order of society’ are Smith’s.]

•The distinction of ranks, the peace and order of soci-
ety, are largely based on the respect that we naturally
have for the rich and powerful.
•The relief and consolation of human misery de-
pend altogether on our compassion for the poor and
wretched.

The peace and order of society is more important than even
the relief of the miserable. So our respect for the great is
most apt to offend by going too far, while our fellow-feeling for
the miserable is more apt to offend by not going far enough.
Moralists urge us to exhibit charity and compassion, and
warn us against the fascination of greatness. It’s true that
this fascination ·can easily be overdone·: it is so powerful
that (4) the rich and great are too often preferred to (2) the
wise and virtuous. Nature has wisely judged that •plain
and obvious differences of birth and fortune provide a more

stable basis for the distinction of ranks, the peace and order
of society, than would the •invisible and often uncertain
differences of wisdom and virtue. The undiscriminating
eyes of the great mob of mankind can see the differences of
birth and fortune well enough, whereas difference of wisdom
and virtue—well, even those who are wise and virtuous
sometimes have trouble distinguishing them! In the order of
all these recommendations, the benevolent wisdom of nature
is equally evident. . . .

Those different beneﬁcent feelings sometimes pull in
different directions, and we don’t—perhaps we can’t—have
any precise rules to settle which way we should go in a given
case. When should (2) friendship give way to (3) gratitude,
or gratitude to friendship? When should (1) the strongest of
all natural affections give way to a regard for (4) the safety
of superiors on whose safety the welfare of the whole society
depends, and when can that choice go the other way without
impropriety? Such questions must be left altogether to the
decision of the man within the breast, the supposed impartial
spectator, the great judge and arbiter of our conduct.
If
we place ourselves completely in his situation, if we really
view ourselves with his eyes, and listen with diligent and
reverential attention to what he suggests to us, his voice will
never deceive us. We shan’t need any applied-ethics rules to
direct our conduct. . . .

Chapter 2: The order in which societies are recom-
mended by nature to our beneﬁcence

The motivational forces that direct the order in which
•individuals are ·naturally· recommended to our beneﬁcence
also direct the order in which •societies are recommended
to it. The ones that we ﬁnd it natural to attend to ﬁrst are
those that are or may be of most importance ·to us·.

120

Smith on Moral Sentiments

Which societies should receive our beneﬁcence

•The state in which we have been born and brought up,
and under the protection of which we continue to live, is
ordinarily the biggest society on whose happiness (or misery)
our good (or bad) conduct can have much inﬂuence. So
ﬁttingly •it’s the one that nature most strongly recommends
to us. Not only we ourselves but all the people we care
about most—our children, our parents, our relatives, our
friends, our benefactors, all those whom we naturally love
and revere the most—are usually included within •it, and
their prosperity and safety depend to some extent on its
prosperity and safety. So nature makes it dear to us not
only through all our selﬁsh feelings but also through all
our private benevolent feelings. On account of our own
connection with it, its prosperity and glory seem to reﬂect
some sort of honour on ourselves. When we compare our
society with others of the same kind, we are proud of its
superiority and are somewhat humiliated if it seems to be
in any way below them. All the illustrious characters that it
has produced in former times. . . .—its warriors, statesmen,
poets, philosophers, and writers of all kinds—we’re inclined
to view with the most partial [opposite of ‘impartial’] admiration,
and to rank (sometimes quite wrongly) above those of all
other nations. The patriot who lays down his life for the
safety of this society—or even for its vain-glory!—appears to
do precisely the right thing. He appears to view himself in
the way the impartial spectator has to view him, as merely
one of the multitude, of no more importance than any of
the others, and as bound at all times to sacriﬁce and devote
himself to the safety, the service, and even the glory of the
greater number. Although this sacriﬁce seems to be perfectly
right and proper, we know how hard it is to make it and
how few people are capable of making it. So someone who
does sacriﬁce himself in this way arouses not only our entire
approval but our highest wonder and admiration; he seems

to deserve all the applause that the most heroic virtue can
deserve. On the other side, the traitor who in some special
situation imagines he can promote his own interests by
betraying the interests of his native country appears to be
of all villains the most detestable. He is disregarding the
judgment of the man within the breast, and shamefully and
basely putting himself ahead of all those with whom he has
any connection.

Our love for our own nation often disposes us to look
with malignant jealousy and envy at the prospering of any
neighbouring nation. All nations live in continual dread
and suspicion of their neighbours, because there is no inde-
pendent superior ·to whom they can appeal· to decide their
disputes, Each sovereign, not expecting much justice from
his neighbours, is inclined to treat them with as little justice
as he expects from them. There are laws of nations—rules
that independent states claim to think they are obliged to
conform to in their dealings with one another—but the regard
for those laws is often little more than mere pretence. [Citing
an example from ancient Rome, Smith distinguishes •the de-
fensible wish for neighbouring nations not to have too much
power from •the coarsely primitive wish for neighbouring
nations to fail in every way. Then:] France and England may
each have some reason to fear the other’s increase of the
naval and military power, but for either of them to envy

the internal happiness and prosperity of the other, the
cultivation of its lands, the advancement of its man-
ufactures, the increase of its commerce, the security
and number of its ports and harbours, its proﬁciency
in all the liberal arts and sciences,

is surely beneath the dignity of two such great nations. Those
are all real improvements of the world we live in. . . . They
all proper objects of national emulation, not of national
prejudice or envy. [To ‘emulate’ something is to try to copy it.]

Smith on Moral Sentiments

Which societies should receive our beneﬁcence

The love for our own country seems not to come from love
for mankind—and indeed sometimes seems to dispose us to
act in ways that are inconsistent with a love for mankind.
France has nearly three times the population of Great
Britain, so that within the great society of mankind France’s
prosperity should appear to be much more important than
Great Britain’s. Yet a British subject who took that view and
accordingly always preferred France’s prosperity to Great
Britain’s would not be thought a good citizen of Great Britain.
We don’t love our country merely as a part of the great society
of mankind; we love it for its own sake, and independently
of any thoughts about mankind in general. The wisdom
that designed the system of human affections, as well as the
system of every other part of nature, seems to have thought
that the best way to further the interests of the great society
of mankind would be for each individual to attend primarily
to the particular portion of it that lies most within the sphere
both of his abilities and of his understanding.

National prejudices and hatreds seldom extend beyond
neighbouring nations. We may weakly and foolishly call the
French our ‘natural enemies’, and it may be that they, equally
weakly and foolishly, think the same about us. Neither they
nor we have any sort of envy for the prosperity of China or
Japan, though we can’t often employ our good-will towards
such distant countries in any way that does them much
good.

The most extensive public benevolence that can com-
monly be exercised to good effect is that of statesmen who
plan and create alliances among neighbouring or near-
neighbouring nations, for the preservation of the so-called
‘balance of power’ or of the general peace and tranquillity of
the states that are involved. Yet the statesmen who plan and
implement such treaties are seldom aiming at anything but
the interest of their respective countries; though sometimes

they are looking wider than that.
historical examples.]

[Smith suggests some

Every independent state is divided into many different
orders and societies, each of which has its own particular
powers, privileges, and immunities. Every individual is
naturally more attached to his own particular order or society
than to any other. His own interests, his own vanity, the
interests and vanity of many of his friends and companions,
commonly have a lot to do with this: he is ambitious to
extend this group’s privileges and immunities, and is zealous
to defend them against the encroachments of every other
order or society.

What is called the constitution of any particular state
depends on how that state is divided into the different orders
and societies that make it up, and on how powers, privileges,
and immunities have been distributed among them.

The stability of a state’s constitution depends on the
ability of each of its particular orders or societies to maintain
its own powers, privileges, and immunities against the
encroachments of all the others. A particular constitution
inevitably undergoes some change whenever the rank and
condition of any of its subordinate parts goes up or down.

All those different orders and societies depend on the
state to which ·they belong, because it’s to the state that·
they owe their security and protection. Even the most
biased member of any one of them will agree to this—i.e.
will agree that his order or society is subordinate to the
state, and dependent for its existence on the prosperity and
preservation of the state as a whole. But it may be hard to
convince such a person that the prosperity and preservation
of the state requires any lessening of the powers etc. of
his own particular order or society. This bias is sometimes
unjust, but that doesn’t mean that it is useless. It holds back
the spirit of innovation, tending to preserve the established

122

Smith on Moral Sentiments

Which societies should receive our beneﬁcence

balance among the different orders and societies into which
the state is divided. While it sometimes appears to obstruct
some political changes that may be fashionable and popular
at the time, it really helps to make the whole system stable
and permanent.

The love of our country ordinarily seems to have two
motivational drivers: (1) a certain respect and reverence for
the constitution or form of government that is actually estab-
lished; and (2) an earnest desire to make our fellow-citizens
as safe, respectworthy, and happy as we can. Someone who
isn’t disposed (1) to respect the laws and to obey the lawful
authorities •is not a citizen; and someone who doesn’t want
to (2) do everything he possibly can to promote the welfare of
the whole society of his fellow-citizens •is not a good citizen.
In times of peace those two motivations generally co-
incide and lead to the same conduct.
It seems obvious
that the best way of maintaining the safe, respectworthy,
and happy situation of our fellow-citizens is to support the
established government—when we see that this government
does maintain them in that situation. But in times of public
discontent, faction, and disorder those two motivations can
pull in different directions, and even a wise man may be
inclined to think that the present government appears plainly
unable to maintain public tranquillity and that some change
should be made in its constitution or form. In such cases,
however, it often needs the highest effort of political wisdom
for a real patriot to decide whether to (1) support and try to
re-establish the authority of the old system or rather (2) to
go along with the more daring but often dangerous spirit of
innovation.

Foreign war and civil faction provide the most splendid
opportunities for the display of public spirit. The hero who
serves his country successfully in foreign war satisﬁes the
wishes of the whole nation, which makes him an object

of universal gratitude and admiration.
In times of civil
discord, the leaders of the opposing parties may be admired
by half their fellow-citizens but are likely to be cursed by the
other half. Their characters and the merit of their respective
services often seem more doubtful, which is why the glory
that is acquired through foreign war is almost always purer
and more splendid than any that can be acquired through
civil faction.

Yet the leader of the successful party ·in a factional
dispute·, if he has enough authority to prevail on his own
friends to act with moderation (and often he doesn’t!), may
be able to serve his country in a much more essential and
important way than the greatest victories and the most
extensive conquests ·in foreign wars·. . . .

Amidst the turbulence and disorder of faction, •a certain
spirit of system is apt to mix itself with •the public spirit that
is based on the love of humanity, on a real fellow-feeling with
the difﬁculties and distresses to which some of our fellow-
citizens are exposed. This spirit of system commonly goes
in the same direction as that gentler public spirit, pumping
energy into it and often inﬂaming it even to the madness of
fanaticism. Nearly always the leaders of the discontented
party display some plausible plan of reformation which,
they claim, will not only remove the difﬁculties and relieve
the distresses immediately complained of, but will prevent
anything like them from ever occurring again. To this end
they propose to rebuild the constitution, altering some of
the most essential parts of a system of government under
which the subjects of a great empire may have enjoyed peace,
security, and even glory through a period of several centuries.
The great mass of party-members are commonly intoxicated
with the imaginary beauty of this ideal system: they have
had no experience of it, but it has been represented to them
in the most dazzling colours in which the eloquence of their

123

Smith on Moral Sentiments

Which societies should receive our beneﬁcence

leaders could paint it. [Calling it ‘ideal’, Smith means merely that
it exists only as an idea that someone has.] Many of those leaders
themselves, though they may at ﬁrst have aimed only at
a growth of their own personal power, eventually become
dupes of their own sophistry, and are as eager for this great
reformation as the weakest and stupidest of their followers.
There are other leaders who keep their own heads free from
this fanaticism, but don’t dare to disappoint the expectation
of their followers; so they are constantly forced to act as if
they were under the common delusion, doing this in deﬁance
of their principles and their conscience. The violence of
the party, refusing all offers of reasonable compromise, by
requiring too much often gets nothing; and difﬁculties and
distresses which with a little moderation might have been
considerably removed and relieved are left with absolutely
no hope of a remedy.

A man whose public spirit is prompted only by humane-
ness and benevolence will respect the established powers
and privileges of individuals, and even more those of the
great orders and societies into which the state is divided. If
he regards some of them as somewhat abusive, he’ll settle for
•moderating things that he often can’t •annihilate without
great violence. . . . He will do his best to •accommodate public
arrangements to the conﬁrmed habits and prejudices of the
people, and to •remedy any inconveniences that ﬂow from the
lack of regulations that the people are unwilling to submit
to. When he can’t establish the right, he won’t be too proud
to ameliorate the wrong. Like Solon, when he can’t establish
the best system of laws he will try to establish the best that
the people can bear.

The man of system is nothing like that. He is apt to be
sure of his own wisdom, and is often so in love with the
supposed beauty of his own ideal plan of government that
he can’t allow the slightest deviation from any part of it. He

goes on to establish it completely and in detail, paying no
attention to the great interests or the strong prejudices that
may oppose it. He seems to imagine that he can arrange
the members of a great society as easily as a hand arranges
the pieces on a chess-board! He forgets that the chessmen’s
only source of motion is what the hand impresses on them,
whereas in the great chess-board of human society every
single piece has its own ·private· source of motion, quite
different from anything that the legislature might choose
to impress on it.
If •those two sources coincide and act
in the same direction, the game of human society will go
on easily and harmoniously, and is likely to be happy and
successful. If •they are opposite or different, the game will
go on miserably and the society will be in the highest degree
of disorder all the time.

The views of a statesman need, no doubt, to be guided
by some •general idea of the perfect state of policy and
law—perhaps even a •systematic idea of these. But to
insist on establishing everything that that idea may seem
to require, and on establishing it all at once and in spite
of all opposition, must often be the highest degree of arro-
gance. The statesman who does that is holding up his own
judgment as the supreme standard of right and wrong. He
imagines himself to be the only wise and worthy man in the
commonwealth, and thinks that his fellow-citizens should
accommodate themselves to him and not he to them. That is
why of all political theorists sovereign princes are by far the
most dangerous! This arrogance ·that I have just described·
is perfectly familiar to them. They have no doubt as to the
immense superiority of their own judgment. So when such
imperial and royal reformers are graciously willing to give
thought to the humdrum topic of the constitution of the
country they have to govern, the worst things they see in it
are obstructions that the country sometimes sets up against

124

Smith on Moral Sentiments

Universal benevolence

the carrying out of their own will. They. . . .consider the
state as made for themselves, not themselves for the state.
So the great object of their ‘reformation’ is to remove those
obstructions, to reduce the authority of the nobility, to take
away the privileges of cities and provinces, and to bring it
about that the greatest individuals and the greatest orders
of the state are as incapable of opposing their commands as
the weakest and most insigniﬁcant.

Chapter 3: Universal benevolence

Although our effective help can’t often be extended to any
society wider than that of our own country, our good-will
isn’t hemmed in by any boundary—it can embrace the
universe. We can’t form any idea of an innocent and sentient
being whom we wouldn’t want to be happy. . . . The idea of a
mischievous sentient being naturally provokes our hatred;
but our hostility to such a being is really an effect of our
universal benevolence. It comes from our sympathy for the
misery and resentment of the other innocent and sentient
beings whose happiness is disturbed by the malice of this
one.

This universal benevolence, however noble and generous
it may be, can’t be the source of any solid happiness for any
man who isn’t thoroughly convinced that all the inhabitants
of the universe, low and high, are under the immediate
care and protection of the great, benevolent, and all-wise
Being who •directs all the movements of nature, and who •is
determined [here = ‘caused’] by his own unalterable perfections
to maintain in it always the greatest possible amount of
happiness. To ·someone who has· this universal benevolence
the mere suspicion of a fatherless world must be the saddest
of all thoughts, involving the thought that all the unknown
regions of inﬁnite and incomprehensible space may be ﬁlled

with nothing but endless misery and wretchedness. All
the splendour of the highest prosperity can’t lighten the
gloom that this dreadful idea must necessarily inﬂict on
imagination; just as, in a wise and virtuous man, all the
sorrow of the most terrible adversity can’t ever dry up the
joy that necessarily arises from the habitual and thorough
conviction of the truth of the contrary system, ·i.e. the truth
of theism·.

The wise and virtuous man is always willing for his own
private interest to be sacriﬁced to the public interest of his
own particular order or society. He is always willing, too, for
the interests of this order or society to be sacriﬁced to the
greater interests of the state of which it is a subordinate part.
So he should be equally willing for all those inferior interests
to be sacriﬁced to the greater interests of the universe—of the
great society of all sentient and thinking beings whose imme-
diate administrator and director is God himself. If he really
does believe that this benevolent and all-wise Being can’t
allow any partial evil that isn’t necessary for the universal
good, he must regard all the misfortunes that may happen to
himself, his friends, his society, or country as necessary for
the prosperity of the universe. This involves believing that
not only should he patiently put up with them but also that
his attitude should be: ‘If I had known all the connections
and dependences of things, I would have sincerely and
devoutly wanted all those misfortunes to happen.’

This noble-minded acceptance of the will of the great
Director of the universe doesn’t seem to be beyond the reach
of human nature. Good soldiers who both love and trust
their general often march with more alacrity and gaiety •to a
forlorn station from which they don’t expect to return than
they would •to one that didn’t involve difﬁculty or danger.
[Smith contrasts these as •‘the noblest thing a man can
do’ and •‘the dullness of ordinary duty’ respectively; and he

125

Smith on Moral Sentiments

Universal benevolence

likens the former of them to what a convinced theist is called
upon to do:] No conductor of an army can deserve more
unlimited trust. . . .than the great Conductor of the universe.
In the greatest disasters a wise man ought to think that
he himself, his friends and his countrymen have only been
ordered to the forlorn station of the universe; that they
wouldn’t have been so ordered if it hadn’t been necessary
for the good of the whole; and that it’s their duty not only
to accept this order humbly but to try to embrace it with
alacrity and joy. Surely a wise man should be capable of
doing what a good soldier is at all times ready to do.

The idea of

the divine Being whose benevolence and wisdom have
from all eternity directed the immense machine of
the universe so as to produce at every moment the
greatest possible amount of happiness

is the most sublime thought human beings can have. Every
other thought necessarily appears mean in comparison with
it. We usually have the highest veneration for anyone whom
we believe to be principally occupied with this sublime
thought; even if his life is altogether contemplative, we often
regard him with a higher kind of religious respect than we

have for the most active and useful servant of the com-
monwealth. The Meditations of Marcus Aurelius, which are
mainly devoted to this subject, may have contributed more
to the general admiration of his character than everything he
did in the course of his just, merciful, and beneﬁcent reign
·as emperor of Rome·.

Still, the administration of the great system of the
universe—the care of the universal happiness of all rational
and sentient beings—is God’s business, not man’s. Man
is assigned a role that is much humbler but also much
more suitable to the limited nature of his powers and his
intellect—namely the care of his own happiness and of the
happiness of his family, his friends, his country. A man
can’t be excused for neglecting this humbler task on the
grounds that he is busy contemplating the more sublime one!
Marcus Aurelius was accused, perhaps wrongly, of doing
this. It was said that while he was busy with philosophical
speculations and thoughts about the welfare of the universe
he neglected the welfare of the Roman empire. The most
sublime theory-building of the contemplative philosopher
can hardly compensate for the neglect of the smallest active
duty.

Section 3: Self-control

A man who acts according to the rules of perfect prudence,
strict justice, and proper benevolence may be said to be
perfectly virtuous. But a complete knowledge of those rules
won’t, unaided, enable him to act in this manner. His own
passions ·play a role in this, and they· are apt to mislead

him—sometimes •driving him to violate all the rules that
in his sober and cool hours he approves of, and sometimes
•seducing him into doing this. The most perfect knowledge
won’t always enable him to do his duty if it isn’t supported
by the most perfect self-control.

126

Smith on Moral Sentiments

Universal benevolence

Some of the best ancient moralists seem to have divided
passions into two classes: (1) those that can’t be restrained,
even for a moment, by a considerable exertion of self-control;
and (2) those that it’s easy to restrain for a short period of
time, although over the course of a lifetime they are apt to
lead us far astray through their continual quiet urgings.

(1) The ﬁrst class consists of •fear and •anger and some
other passions that are mixed or connected with those two.
(2) The second class contains love of ease, of pleasure, of
applause, and of many other selﬁsh satisfactions. Extrava-
gant fear and furious anger are often hard to restrain, even
for a moment. As for the love of ease and the others in
(2), it’s always easy to restrain those for a short period of
time; but through their continual urgings they often mislead
us into weaknesses that we later have much reason to be
ashamed of. We could say that the (1) passions •drive us
from our duty, whereas the (2) passions •seduce us from it.
The ancient moralists that I have referred to used the labels
‘fortitude’, ‘manliness’, and ‘strength of mind’ for control
over the passions in group (1); and ‘temperance’, ‘decency’,
‘modesty’, and ‘moderation’ for control over the ones in group
(2).

Control of each of those sets of passions has a beauty
that comes from its utility—from its enabling us always to
act according to the dictates of prudence, of justice, and of
proper benevolence. But it also has an ·intrinsic· beauty of
its own, and seems to deserve a certain degree of esteem
and admiration for its own sake, because of the qualities
of the exertion involved in such self-control—its strength
and greatness with passions in group (1), and its uniformity,
evenness and unﬂinching steadiness in group (2).

A man who keeps his tranquillity unaltered at a time
when he is in danger, or being tortured, or nearing death,
and doesn’t allow a word or gesture to escape him that

doesn’t perfectly match the feelings of the most uninvolved
spectator, inevitably commands a high degree of admiration
from us. [Smith elaborates on this, mentioning great men
of the remote past (Socrates) and of the more recent past
(Sir Thomas More) who went to their deaths in a calm and
digniﬁed manner, and whose great posthumous reputation
has derived from this. We even have a certain admiration for
a truly wicked man who deserves to be sent to the gallows, if
he goes there ‘with decency and ﬁrmness’.]

War is the great school both for acquiring and for exer-
cising this sort of magnanimity. Death is called the ‘king’ of
terrors; and a man who has conquered his fear of death isn’t
likely to be thrown off-balance by the approach of any other
natural evil. In war, men become familiar with death, and
this cures them of the superstitious horror with which death
is viewed by weak and inexperienced. They consider it merely
as the loss of life, and as an object of aversion only to the
extent that life happens to be an object of desire. Also, they
learn from experience that many seemingly great dangers are
not as great as they appear, and that with courage, energy
and presence of mind they often have a good chance of
extricating themselves with honour from situations where
at ﬁrst they could see no hope. [Smith elaborates on our
admiration for the calmly bold warrior, even one who is
ﬁghting on the wrong side in a wicked war.]

Control over anger often seems to be just as generous [see
note on page 11] and noble as control over fear. Many of the
most admired examples of ancient and modern eloquence
have been proper expressions of righteous indignation. The
speeches of Demosthenes against Philip of Macedonia, and
Cicero’s speeches against Catiline, derive all their beauty
from the noble propriety with which indignation is expressed
in them. And this just indignation is simply anger restrained
and properly damped down to something that the impartial

127

Smith on Moral Sentiments

Universal benevolence

spectator can enter into. The blustering and noisy passion
that goes beyond this is always odious and offensive, and it
draws us in not on the side of the angry man but on the side
of the man he is angry with. The nobleness of pardoning
often seems better than even the most perfect propriety of
resenting. When

•the offending party has properly acknowledged what
he did, or even without that when
•the public interest requires that mortal enemies
should unite to carry out some important duty,

the man who sets aside all animosity and acts with con-
ﬁdence and cordiality towards the person who has most
grievously offended him seems to be entitled to our highest
admiration.

But the command of anger doesn’t always appear in such
splendid colours. Fear is contrary to anger, and is often the
motive that restrains it; and in such cases the lowness of
the motive takes away the nobleness of the restraint. Anger
prompts us to attack, and giving way to it seems sometimes
to show a sort of courage and superiority to fear. People
sometimes take pride in having acted on their anger; no-one
takes pride in having acted out of fear!. . . .

Acting according to the dictates of prudence, justice, and
proper beneﬁcence seems to have no great merit when there’s
no temptation to do otherwise. But

•acting with cool deliberation in the midst of the great-
est dangers and difﬁculties,
•observing religiously the sacred rules of justice, in
spite of being tempted by self-interest and provoked
by great injuries to violate them; and
•never allowing the benevolence of our temperament to
be damped or discouraged by malignity and ingrati-
tude on the part of some beneﬁciaries,

is the character of the most exalted wisdom and virtue.

Self-control is not only itself a great virtue, but it seems
to be the source of most of the glow of all the other virtues.
Control over one’s fear and over one’s anger are always
great and noble powers; and when they’re directed by justice
and benevolence they increase the splendour of those other
virtues as well as being great virtues themselves. But when
they are directed by other motives they can be (though
still great and respectworthy) excessively dangerous. [Calm
self-control in the deceitful pursuit of really bad objectives
has sometimes been admired by people with good judgment,
Smith says; and he cites examples, ancient and modern.
Then:] This character of dark and deep dissimulation occurs
most commonly in times of great public disorder, in the
violence of faction and civil war. When the law has become
largely powerless, when perfect innocence can’t guarantee
safety, a concern for self-defence obliges most men to re-
sort to dexterity, to skill, and to apparent agreement with
whatever party happens to be uppermost at the moment.
This false character is also often accompanied by cool and
determined courage, which is needed because being detected
in such a deception often leads to death. . . .

Control over one’s less violent and turbulent passions
seems less open to being abused for any pernicious purpose.
Temperance, decency, modesty, and moderation are always
likeable, and can seldom be directed to any bad end. It is
from the unremitting steadiness of those gentler exercises
of self-control that the likeable virtue of •chastity and the
respectworthy virtues of •industry and •frugality derive all
the sober shine that they have. The conduct of everyone
who is content to walk in the humble paths of private and
peaceable life has a beauty and grace that are less •dazzling
but not always less •pleasing than the beauty and grace of
the more splendid actions of the hero, the statesman, or the
legislator.

128

Smith on Moral Sentiments

Universal benevolence

After what I have already said in different parts of this
work concerning the nature of self-control, I don’t think I
need to go into any more detail concerning those virtues. All
I’ll say now is that the intensity-scale’s •point of propriety,
the •degree of a passion that the impartial spectator approves
of, is differently placed for different passions. (1) Of some
passions it’s better to have too much than to have too
little, an excess being less disagreeable than a shortage;
and in such passions the point of propriety seems to stand
high—i.e. nearer to ‘too much’ than to ‘too little’. (2) With
other passions a shortage is less disagreeable than an excess;
and their point of propriety seems to stand low—i.e. nearer
to ‘too little’ than to ‘too much’. The (1) passions are the ones
the spectator is most disposed to sympathize with, the (2)
the ones he is least likely to sympathize with. Also, the (1)
passions are the ones that feel good to the person who has
the passion, and the (2) passions are the ones that feel bad
to the person who has them. So out of this we get a general
rule:

(1) The passions that the spectator is most disposed to
sympathize with, and that have a correspondingly
high point of propriety, are the ones that feel good to
the person who has them; and

(2) the passions that the spectator is least disposed to
sympathize with, and that have a correspondingly low
point of propriety, are the ones that feel disagreeable
to the person who has them.

I haven’t found a single exception to this general rule. A few
examples will sufﬁciently explain it while also demonstrating
its truth. [Smith’s ‘few examples’ and his comments on them ﬁll the
remaining thirty book-pages of this section. The present version will
reduce the length considerably,]

It’s possible for someone to be •too much disposed to
have the affections that tend to unite men in society—

humaneness, kindness, natural affection, friendship, esteem.
[Notice that in that sentence Smith uses ‘affections’ in the broad sense
and ‘affection’ in the narrow one—see note on page 6.] But even this
•excess makes the person interesting to everybody [=, roughly,
‘gives us all a concern for him, puts us all on his side, sort of’]. We
blame him for it, but we still regard it with compassion and
even with kindness, and never with dislike. We’re sorry
rather than angry about it. To the person himself, having
such excessive affections is often not only agreeable but
delicious. On some occasions, especially when directed
towards unworthy objects (as it too often is), it exposes him
to much real and heartfelt distress. Even then, though, a
well-disposed person will regard him with intense pity, and
will be highly indignant with those who despise him as weak
and imprudent. As for having •too little disposition to have
such feelings—what we call ‘hardness of heart’—it makes a
man insensitive to the feelings and distresses of other people,
while also making them insensitive to his. This excludes him
from the friendship of all the world, cutting him off from the
best and most comfortable of all social enjoyments.

As for the disposition to have the affections that drive
men away from one another, tending to break the bands of
human society (so to speak)—i.e. the disposition to anger,
hatred, envy, malice, revenge—one is more apt to offend
by having too much of this disposition than by having too
little. Having too much of it makes a man wretched and
miserable in his own mind, and draws down on him the
hatred, and sometimes even the horror, of other people. It’s
not often that anyone is complained of for having too little of
this disposition, but there is such a thing as having too little
of it. The lack of proper indignation is a most essential defect
in the manly character, and it often makes a man incapable
of protecting himself or his friends from insult and injustice.
The odious and detestable passion of envy consists in a

129

Smith on Moral Sentiments

Universal benevolence

misdirected excess of a certain motivational drive, and it’s
possible to have too little of that drive. Envy is the passion
that views with malignant dislike the greater success of
people who are really entitled to all the success they have had.
A man who in matters of consequence tamely allows other
people who are not entitled to any such success to rise above
him or get before him is rightly condemned as poor-spirited.
This weakness is commonly based on laziness, sometimes
on good nature, on a dislike for confrontation and for bustle
and pleading, and sometimes also on a sort of ill-judged
magnanimity. [This last basis for poor-spiritedness, Smith
says, involves the person’s having a dismissive attitude to
the advantages that he is passing up, and fancying that he’ll
be able to keep up this attitude indeﬁnitely. He is apt to be
wrong in this belief, and to end up with ‘a most malignant
envy’ and hatred for the success of the others.]

One is more likely to offend by •being too sensitive to
personal danger and distress than by •not being sensitive
enough to these. (This is similar to being too sensitive or not
sensitive enough to personal provocation.) No character is
more contemptible than that of a coward; no character is
more admired than that of the man who faces death bravely,
maintaining his tranquillity and presence of mind amidst the
most dreadful dangers. [Smith develops this line of thought,
mainly repeating things he has said earlier.]

But although our sensitivity to our own injuries and
misfortunes is usually •too strong, it can be •too weak. A
man who feels little for his own misfortunes will always feel
less for those of other people, and be less disposed to relieve
them. [And so on, as Smith develops the general theme that
a proper care for the welfare of others requires a proper care
for one’s own interests. The most striking thing here is the
description of the internalized impartial spectator as ‘the
great inmate, the great demi-god within the breast’.]

[Then a paragraph about a moral risk involved in having
too ﬁne a sensitivity to personal injury, danger and distress.
It’s possible to have this and yet behave well, Smith says,
because this extreme sensitivity can be controlled by ‘the
authority of the judge within the breast’. But this may be
too fatiguing for the inner judge, giving him ‘too much to do’.
In such a case, Smith says, there will be a constant inner
conﬂict between (for example) cowardice and conscience,
depriving the person of ‘internal tranquillity and happiness’.
He continues:] A wise man whom Nature has endowed with
this too-ﬁne sensitivity, and whose too-lively feelings haven’t
been sufﬁciently blunted and hardened by early education
and proper exercise, will do whatever he decently can to avoid
situations for which he isn’t perfectly ﬁtted. . . . A certain
boldness, a certain ﬁrmness of nerves and hardiness of con-
stitution, whether natural or acquired, are undoubtedly the
best preparatives for all the great exercises of self-control. . . .
It is also possible to have too much, or to have too little,
sensitivity to the pleasures, amusements and enjoyments of
human life. Having too much seems less disagreeable than
having too little. A •strong propensity for joy is certainly more
pleasing—to the person himself and to the spectator—than a
•dull numbness towards objects of amusement and diversion.
We are charmed with the gaiety of youth, and even with the
playfulness of childhood, but we soon grow weary of the
ﬂat and tasteless solemnity that too often accompanies old
age. It can happen that a great propensity for joy etc. isn’t
restrained by a sense of propriety—is unsuitable to the time
or the place, or to the age or the situation of the person—so
that in giving way to it the person is neglecting his interests
or his duty; and when that happens, the propensity is rightly
blamed as excessive, and as harmful both to the individual
and to the society. But in most of these cases the chief fault
is not so much the strength of the propensity for joy as the

130

Smith on Moral Sentiments

weakness of the sense of propriety and duty. . . .

ourselves, or really below it.

[The twenty-odd book-pages that Smith has ahead of him in this
section are entirely devoted to ‘self-estimation’—thinking too highly of
oneself, not thinking highly enough of oneself, or getting it right.]

One’s estimate of oneself may be too high, and it may be
too low. It is so agreeable to think highly of ourselves, and
so disagreeable to take a low view of ourselves, that for the
person himself some degree of over-rating must be much
less disagreeable than any degree of under-rating. But it
may be thought that things must appear quite differently to
the impartial spectator, who must always ﬁnd under-rating
less disagreeable than over-rating. . . .

In estimating our own merit, judging our own character
and conduct, there are two different standards to which we
naturally compare them. (1) One is the idea of exact propriety
and perfection, so far as each of us can comprehend that
idea. (2) The other is ·the idea of· a certain approximation
to exact propriety and perfection—speciﬁcally, the degree of
perfection etc. that is commonly achieved in the world, the
degree that most of our friends and companions, and most
of our rivals and competitors, may have actually arrived
at. We don’t often—I’m inclined to think we don’t ever—try
to judge ourselves without paying some attention to both
these standards. But different men distribute their attention
between them differently; so indeed does one man at different
times.

So far as our attention is directed towards (1) the ﬁrst
standard, ·even· the wisest and best of us can see nothing
but weakness and imperfection in his own character and
conduct, ﬁnding no reason for arrogance and presumption,
and plenty of reason for humility, regret and repentance.
So far as our attention is directed towards (2) the second
standard, we may be affected in either way, feeling ourselves
to be really above the standard to which we are comparing

The wise and virtuous man directs his attention mainly
to (1) the ﬁrst standard, the idea of exact propriety and
perfection. There exists in every man’s mind an idea of
this kind, gradually formed from his observations on the
character and conduct both of himself and of other people.
It is slowly and steadily under construction by the great
demigod within the breast, the great judge and arbiter of
conduct. [Smith writes about how the wise and virtuous man
constantly measures himself against this standard, trying
to get closer to it in his own character and conduct. But
never fully succeeding, because, Smith says, ‘he is imitating
the work of a divine artist, which can never be equalled’.
He may cheer himself up by comparing himself with (2) the
second standard, ‘but he is necessarily much more humbled
by (1) one comparison than he ever can be elevated by (2)
the other’. And he won’t let the results of (2) the second
comparison lead him to behave arrogantly or dismissively
towards other people.]

In all the liberal and ingenious arts [see note on page 99]—
painting, poetry, music, eloquence, philosophy—the great
artist always feels the real imperfection of his own best works,
and is more aware than anyone else is of how far short they
fall of the •ideal perfection of which he has formed some
conception. He does what he can to imitate that ideal, but
he despairs of ever equalling it. Only the inferior artist is
ever perfectly satisﬁed with his own works. He has little
conception of •ideal perfection, and doesn’t think about it
much. What he mostly compares his works with are the
works of other artists, perhaps less good artists than he is.
[Smith decorates this point with an anecdote: a great French
poet said that no great man is ever completely satisﬁed with
his own works, and an inferior poet replied that he was
always completely satisﬁed with his! Smith then goes on

131

Smith on Moral Sentiments

Universal benevolence

to say that the situation of an artist in relation to his work
is not after all a good model of the situation of a good man
in relation to his whole life. He handles this point in terms
not of (1) as a standard by which to evaluate one’s work or
one’s life but rather of it as a standard by which to make
one’s works or to live one’s life:] But to support and ﬁnish
off (if I may put it that way) the conduct of a whole life to
some resemblance to this ideal perfection is surely much
more difﬁcult than to work up to an equal resemblance any
of the productions of any of the ingenious arts. The artist
sits down to his work undisturbed, at leisure, in the full
possession and recollection of all his skill, experience, and
knowledge. The wise man must support the propriety of his
own conduct in health and in sickness, in success and in
disappointment, in the hour of fatigue and drowsy indolence
as well as in that of the most awakened attention. The most
sudden and unexpected assaults of difﬁculty and distress
must never surprise him. The injustice of other people must
never provoke him to injustice. The violence of faction must
never confound him. All the hardships and hazards of war
must never either dishearten or appal him.

[The next topic is the person who, when he judges himself
by (2) the second standard—the one set by how well the
general run of people are performing—rightly thinks that he
is ‘very much above it’. If this person doesn’t attend carefully
to (1) the ideal standard (and most such people don’t), he
will become arrogant and inappropriately self-admiring, and
will often persuade the gullible multitude to take him at
his (over-)valuation. This creates for him a kind of ‘noisy
fame’ that may stay with him down the centuries. It may
be—Smith allows—that a high-achieving person needed this
self-overestimation—both to embolden him to embark on his
ventures and to get others to join and support him in them.
But if he becomes (by worldly standards) extremely success-

ful while still having this unduly high opinion of himself,
he may be betrayed into ‘a vanity that approaches almost
to insanity and folly’. Smith cites the ancient examples of
Alexander the Great and Julius Caesar. Intelligent as Caesar
was, he says, he liked being said to have descended from
the goddess Venus; and he was guilty of various instances
of ‘an almost childish vanity’, which may have helped to
motivate his assassins. Then:] The religion and manners of
modern times don’t encourage our great men to think they
are gods or even prophets. But the combination of success
and popularity has led many of the greatest of them to credit
themselves with far more importance and far more ability
than they really possess; and this has sometimes pushed
them into rash and sometimes ruinous adventures. [The only
exception to this in modern times, Smith says, is the great
Duke of Marlborough, an enormously successful general
who was never undermined by immodesty.]

In the humble projects of private life as well as in the
ambitious and proud pursuit of high rank and high ofﬁce,
great ability and success at the outset often encourage people
to tackle projects that are bound to lead to bankruptcy and
ruin in the end.

[Smith now embarks on four book-pages of reﬂection
about how self-overestimation ﬁgures in the lives and repu-
tations of notably able people who are guilty of it. He repeats
at length that it can be an aid to success but can also be
a trap, leading the person to ruin himself in one way or
another; and he describes in glowing terms the situation of
an able person who is truly modest. He speculates on the
interplay, in a great man’s reputation, between knowledge
of his real successes and inﬂated beliefs about how great he
was—e.g. what would Caesar’s reputation be now if he had
lost the battle of Pharsalia? He describes in some detail the
disgusting moral depths to which a great man—Alexander

132

Smith on Moral Sentiments

Universal benevolence

the Great—descended because of the weight of his grossly
exaggerated idea of who he was. And he also describes
a further upshot:] The humble, admiring, and ﬂattering
friends whom Alexander left in power and authority at his
death divided his empire among themselves, and after having
thus robbed his family and kindred of their inheritance, put
to death every single surviving member of the family, male
and female, one by one.

[The next paragraph leads Smith into one special depart-
ment of the self-overestimation topic, a department that
will be his topic through the remaining ten book-pages of
the section:] Faced with the excessive self-estimation of the
splendid people in whom we observe a notable superior-
ity above (2) the common level of mankind, we don’t just
•pardon it but often •thoroughly enter into it and sympathize
with it. We call such people ‘spirited’, ‘magnanimous’, and
‘high-minded’—labels that all convey a considerable degree
of praise and admiration. But we can’t enter into and
sympathize with •the excessive self-estimation of people in
whom we don’t see any such distinguished superiority. We’re
disgusted and revolted by •it, and we ﬁnd it hard to forgive
and hard to put up with! We call it ‘pride’, a word that
•usually conveys a considerable degree of blame, or ‘vanity’,
a word that •always does so. [This version will use those two words
exactly as Smith does, not getting into questions about whether what
they meant to him is exactly what they mean to us. (Hume in Treatise II
treats them as synonyms.)]

Pride and vanity are alike in some ways, because each is
a variety of self-overestimation; but in many respects they
are different.

The proud man is sincere: he really is thoroughly con-
vinced of his own superiority, though it’s not always easy
to see what this conviction is based on. He wants you to
view him in just the way he views himself when he looks

at himself from your viewpoint. All he demands from you
(he thinks) is justice. If you seem not to respect him as he
respects himself, he is offended rather than humiliated, and
feels the kind of indignant resentment he would feel if you
had harmed him in some way. (·He would feel humiliated
only if he had a tentative high opinion of himself and was
looking to you to conﬁrm him in it·.) Even then, he doesn’t
condescend to explain his reasons for his own conviction of
his worth. He is too proud to make an effort to win your
esteem. He even acts as though he despises it, and tries to
keep his end up by making you aware not of how high he is
but of how low you are. He seems to want not so much to
arouse your esteem for him as to grind down your esteem for
yourself.

The vain man is not sincere: he usually isn’t convinced,
in his heart of hearts, that he really has the superiority that
he wants you to ascribe to him. He wants you to view him
in much more splendid colours than those in which he can
view himself when he places himself in your situation and
supposes you to know everything that he knows. So when
it seems that you view him in different colours, perhaps in
his proper colours, he is humiliated rather than offended.
He takes every opportunity to display the grounds for his
claim to the character that he wants you to ascribe to him;
he does this by ostentatious and unnecessary parades of the
good qualities and accomplishments that he does possess in
some tolerable degree, and sometimes even by false claims
to good qualities that he doesn’t have, or that he does have
but only in such a low degree that he might as well be said
not to have them at all. Far from despising your esteem, he
anxiously and busily courts it. Far from wishing to grind
down your self-estimation, he is happy to accept it, in the
hope that you will accept his own in return. He ﬂatters in
order to be ﬂattered. He works on pleasing people; and he

133

Smith on Moral Sentiments

Universal benevolence

tries to bribe you into a good opinion of him by politeness and
acceptance, and sometimes even by giving real and essential
help—though often in an unnecessarily showy manner.

The vain man sees the respect that is paid to rank and
fortune, and wants to usurp this respect as well as respect
for talents and virtues. So his dress, his art collection, his
carriage and horses, his way of living all announce a higher
rank and a greater fortune than he really has; and in order to
support this foolish deception for a few years early in his life,
he often reduces himself to poverty and distress later on. . . .
Of all the illusions of vanity this may be the most common.
Obscure strangers visiting foreign countries, or paying a
brief visit to the capital of their own country, often try to
practise it; and although this is foolish and most unworthy
of a man of sense, it isn’t quite as foolish in these cases as it
is on most other occasions. If their visit is short, they may
escape any disgraceful detection; and after they have given
full play to their vanity for a few months or a few years, they
can return home and start living frugally so as to recover
from the extravagant spending during the visit.

A proud man is seldom guilty of this folly. His sense of
his own dignity makes him careful not to become anyone’s
dependent; and if his fortune isn’t large he will—while
wanting to be decent—be carefully frugal and careful in all
his expenses. He is offended by the vain man’s ostentatious
extravagance, which may out-spend his own. It provokes his
indignation as an insolent assumption of a rank to which the
vain man isn’t entitled, and he never talks about it without
loading it with the harshest and severest reproaches.

The proud man doesn’t always feel at his ease in the
company of his equals, let alone his superiors. He can’t give
up •his lofty claims, and the faces and conversation of such
company awe him so much that he doesn’t dare to display
•them. He resorts to humbler company, for which he has

little respect, and which he wouldn’t willingly choose and
doesn’t ﬁnd in the least agreeable—I mean the company of
his inferiors, his ﬂatterers, and his dependants. He seldom
visits his superiors; and when he does, it’s not because he
will get any real satisfaction from such a visit, but rather
to show that he is entitled to keep such people company.
As Lord Clarendon says about the Earl of Arundel: he
sometimes went to court because that’s the only place where
he could he could ﬁnd a greater man than himself, and he
seldom went to court because it’s a place where he found a
greater man than himself!

The vain man is different. He seeks the company of
his superiors as much as the proud man shuns it. He
seems to think that their splendour reﬂects a splendour
onto those who are often in their company. He haunts
the courts of kings and the receptions of ministers, and
puts on the manner of someone who is •a candidate for
fortune and promotion, when really he has the much more
precious happiness, if he knew how to enjoy it, of not being
•one!
[Smith adds details about how the vain man treats
his superiors, ending with:] . . . often ﬂattery, though mostly
pleasant ﬂattery delivered with a light touch, and seldom the
gross and overdone ﬂattery of a parasite. The proud man,
on the other hand, never ﬂatters, and is often hardly civil to
anybody.

Notwithstanding the falsity of its basis, however, vanity
is usually a sprightly, cheerful, and often good-natured
passion. Pride is always grave, sullen, and severe. Even
the falsehoods of the vain man are innocent falsehoods,
meant to raise himself, not to lower other people. The proud
man (let’s be fair) doesn’t often go as low as falsehood; but
when he does, his falsehoods are far from innocent. They
are all trouble-making, and meant to lower other people.
He is full of indignation against people who are accorded

134

Smith on Moral Sentiments

Universal benevolence

a superiority that he thinks they don’t deserve; and this
makes him energetic in saying what he can to undermine
the supposed basis for their superiority, and to pass on,
uncritically, stories that discredit them. The worst falsehoods
of vanity are all so-called ‘white lies’; when pride sinks to
the level of falsehoods, they are falsehoods of the opposite
colour!

Our dislike of pride and vanity generally inclines us to
rank •below rather than above the common level the people
we think of as proud or vain. I think we are usually wrong
about this, and that the proud man and the vain one are
often and perhaps usually a good deal •above the common
level, though nowhere near as much above it as the proud
man thinks he is or as the vain man wants you to think he
is. . . . Pride is often accompanied by many •respectworthy
virtues—truthfulness, integrity, a high sense of honour,
cordial and steady friendship, unshakable ﬁrmness and
resolution. Vanity is often accompanied by many •likeable
virtues—humaneness, politeness, a desire to be helpful in
all little matters, and sometimes real generosity in great
matters. . . . In the last century, the French were accused
of vanity by their rivals and enemies, while the Spanish
were accused of pride; and foreign nations were inclined to
regard the French as more likeable and the Spanish as more
respectworthy.

[Smith’s next three points can be reported brieﬂy. (i) The
word ‘vain’ is never used approvingly; ‘proud’ is sometimes
used as a term of praise, though when that happens ‘pride is
being confused with magnanimity’. (ii) A proud man is likely
to be too contented with himself to try for self-improvement,
unlike the vain man, who would like to have the qualities
and talents that people admire. A vain young man shouldn’t
be discouraged from trying to become something worthy of
admiration; and his vanity—which is really just his trying to

get admiration too soon—should be treated with forbearance.
(iii) Pride and vanity often go together in one man, and Smith
explains why this is natural:] It is natural that a man who
thinks more highly of himself than he deserves should want
other people to think still more highly of him; and that a
man who wants other people to think more highly of him
than he thinks of himself should also think more highly of
himself than he deserves.

[On page 129 Smith introduced the ‘point of propriety’ for this or that
passion, and discussed ’too much’ and ‘too little’ for various passions.
When on page 131 he turned to self-estimation, this led him into two
topics—•different standards for self-estimation, and •pride and vanity—
that mostly breathed the air of ‘too high’. Now at last he is going to
discuss the ‘too low’ side of self-estimation.]

Men whose merit is considerably above the common level
sometimes under-rate themselves. Such a person is often
pleasant to be with, in private: his companions are at ease in
the society of such a perfectly modest and unassuming man.
But those companions, though they are fond of him, are
likely not to have much respect; and the warmth of their fond-
ness usually won’t be enough to make up for the coolness of
their respect. That won’t apply if the companions have more
discernment and more generosity than people usually have.
Men of ordinary discernment never rate a person higher
‘Even he seems unsure
than he appears to rate himself.
whether he is perfectly ﬁt for the post we are considering him
for’, they say, and they immediately appoint some impudent
blockhead who has no doubt about his qualiﬁcations. And
even discerning people, if they are mean-minded, will take
advantage of his simplicity and impertinently set themselves
up as superior to him although they are nothing of the
sort. His good nature may enable him to put up with this
for some time, but he’ll grow tired of it eventually. That
is apt to happen when it is too late, i.e. when the rank

135

Smith on Moral Sentiments

Universal benevolence

that he ought to have had is lost irrecoverably, having been
stolen—through his failure to push his own merits—by some
more pushy but less meritorious companion. . . . Such a man,
too unassuming and unambitious in his younger years, is
often insigniﬁcant, complaining, and discontented in his old
age.

The unfortunate folk whom nature has formed a good deal
below the common level seem sometimes to rate themselves
as even further below it than they really are. This humil-
ity appears sometimes to sink them into idiotism.
[Smith
could mean ‘sink them into behaving like idiots’ or ‘sink them into being
idiots’. The ensuing discussion implies a challenge to the very distinction
between those two.] Examine idiots carefully and you’ll ﬁnd
that many of them have faculties of understanding that
are quite as strong as those of many people who, though
acknowledged to be dull and stupid, are not classiﬁed as
‘idiots’ by anyone. Many idiots who have had no more than
ordinary education have learned to •read, •write, and •do
sums tolerably well. And many persons who were never
classiﬁed as ‘idiots’ and who received careful education have
never been able to acquire a reasonable level in any one of
•those three accomplishments—not even when, later on in
life, they have had spirit enough to try to learn what their
·They have escaped
early education hadn’t taught them.
being classed as ‘idiots’ because· an instinct of pride has
led them •to set themselves on a level with their equals
in age and situation, and—with courage and ﬁrmness—•to
maintain their proper station among their companions. By
an opposite instinct, the idiot feels himself to be below every
company into which you can introduce him. Ill-treatment
(which is extremely likely to come his way) can throw him
into violent ﬁts of rage and fury. But no good usage, no
kindness or patience, can ever raise him to converse with you
as your equal. If you can bring him into conversation with

you at all, you’ll often ﬁnd his answers •relevant enough and
even •sensible; but they will always be marked by his strong
sense of his own great inferiority. He seems to shrink back
from your look and conversation, and to feel—seeing himself
from your viewpoint—that despite your apparent kindness
to him you can’t help considering him as immensely below
you. (a) Some idiots—perhaps most idiots—seem really to be
immensely below the rest of us, mainly or entirely because
of a certain numbness or sluggishness in their faculties of
the understanding. But there are (b) other idiots whose
faculties of understanding don’t appear to be more sluggish
or numb than in (c) many people who are not regarded as
idiots. ·Then what is the difference between the (b) group
and the (c) group? It’s that· the instinct of pride that is
needed if they are to maintain themselves on a level with
their brethren seems to be totally lacking in the (b) group
and not in the (c) group.

So it seems that the degree of self-estimation that con-
tributes most to the happiness and contentment of the
person himself seems also to be the degree that is most
agreeable to the impartial spectator. The man who values
himself as he ought and no more than he ought is nearly
always valued by other people at the level that he thinks is
right. He wants no more than is due to him, and he settles
for that with complete satisfaction.

The proud man and the vain man, on the other hand, are
constantly dissatisﬁed. One is tormented with indignation at
the high ranking that other people get (wrongly, he thinks).
The other is in continual fear of the shame that he predicts
he would suffer if his deceit were discovered. Take the special
case of a vain man who makes extravagant claims about him-
self although he really does have a ﬁne mind and splendid
abilities and virtues and is also favoured by good luck. His
claims will be accepted by the multitude, whose applause

136

Smith on Moral Sentiments

Universal benevolence

he doesn’t care about much; but they won’t be accepted
by the wise people whose approval is just what he is most
anxious to get. He feels that they see through his deceptions
and suspects that they despise him for them; and he may
well suffer the cruel misfortune of becoming. . . .a furious
and vindictive enemy of the very people whose friendship he
would have most enjoyed.

Though our dislike for the proud and the vain often
inclines us to rank them rather below than above their real
level, we seldom venture to treat them badly unless we are
provoked by some particular and personal impertinence. In
common cases we ﬁnd it more comfortable to accept their
folly and adjust ourselves to it as best we can. But with the
man who under-rates himself the situation is different: we
usually do to him all the injustice that he does to himself,
and often much more (unless we are more discerning and
more generous than most people are). As well as being more
unhappy in his own feelings than either the proud or the
vain man is, he is much more open ·than they are· to every
sort of ill-treatment by other people.
It is almost always
better to be •a little too proud than to be •in any respect too
humble. In the sentiment of self-estimation, some degree
of excess seems—to the person himself and to the impartial
spectator—to be less disagreeable than any degree of defect.

In this respect, therefore, self-estimation is like every
other emotion, passion, and habit: the degree that is most
agreeable to the impartial spectator is likewise most agree-
able to the person himself. . . .

Conclusion of Part VI

Concern for our own happiness recommends to us the virtue
of (1) prudence; concern for the happiness of other people
recommends to us the virtues of (2) justice, which restrains
us from harming their happiness, and (3) beneﬁcence, which
prompts us to promote it. Quite apart from any considera-
tions about the sentiments of other people—facts about what
those sentiments

are, or
ought to be, or
would be if such-and-such were the case

—(1) prudence is basically recommended to us by our self-
ish affections, and (2) justice and (3) benevolence by our
benevolent ones. But a regard for the sentiments of other
people enters the picture after the basis is laid, serving to
enforce and to direct the practice of all those virtues. Anyone
who has for many years walked steadily and uniformly in
the paths of prudence, justice, and proper beneﬁcence has
been primarily guided in his conduct by a concern for the
sentiments of •the imagined impartial spectator, •the great
inmate of the breast, •the great judge and arbiter of conduct.
If in the course of the day we have in any way swerved from
the rules that •he prescribes to us, if we have

(1) gone too far or not far enough in our frugality,
(2) in any way harmed the interests or happiness of
our neighbour (through passion or by mistake), or
(3) neglected a clear and proper opportunity to do
something for those interests and that happiness,

it is this inmate of the breast who, in the evening, challenges
us concerning those omissions and violations, and his re-
proaches often make us blush inwardly for our folly and
inattention to our own happiness and for our still greater
indifference and inattention to the happiness of other people.

137

Smith on Moral Sentiments

Universal benevolence

But though the virtues of (1) prudence, (2) justice, and
(3) beneﬁcence can at different times be recommended to
us almost equally by two different sources (·our feelings
and those of the impartial spectator·), the virtues of (4)
self-control are in most cases recommended to us almost
entirely by one source—our sense of propriety, our regard for
the sentiments of the imagined impartial spectator. Without
the restraint that this imposes, every passion would usually
rush headlong to its own gratiﬁcation. . . . No facts about time
or place would restrain vanity from loud and impertinent
showing off, or restrain voluptuousness from open, indecent,
and scandalous indulgence. In nearly every case, the only
thing that overawes all those mutinous and turbulent pas-
sions, toning them down into something that the impartial
spectator can enter into and sympathize with, is a concern
for what the sentiments of other people are, or ought to be,
or would be if such-and-such were the case.

It’s true that sometimes those passions are restrained not
so much by •a sense of their impropriety as by •a prudential
consideration of the bad consequences that might follow from
letting them have their way. In these cases the passions are
restrained but aren’t always subdued, and they often remain
lurking in the breast with all their original fury. The man
whose anger is restrained by fear doesn’t always get rid of

his anger, but only delays acting on it until it is safer for him
to do so. Contrast that with the following case:

A man tells someone else about the harm that has
been done to him, and immediately feels the fury of
his passion being cooled and calmed down through
sympathy with the more moderate sentiments of his
companion. He adopts those more moderate senti-
ments for himself, coming to view the harm not in the
black and atrocious colours in which he had originally
saw it but in the much milder and fairer light in which
his companion naturally views it.

This man doesn’t just restrain his anger; he to some extent
subdues it. The passion becomes really less than it was
before, and less capable of arousing him to the violent and
bloody revenge that he may at ﬁrst have thought of inﬂicting.
When any passion is restrained by the sense of propriety
it will be somewhat moderated and subdued. But when
a passion is restrained only by prudential considerations
of some sort, it is often inﬂamed by the restraint, and
sometimes. . . .it bursts out with tenfold fury and violence in
some context where nobody is thinking about the matter and
the outburst is merely absurd.

Part VII: Systems of moral philosophy

Section 1: The questions that ought to be examined in a theory of moral sentiments

If we examine the most famous and remarkable of the various
theories that have been given regarding the nature and origin
of our moral sentiments, we’ll ﬁnd that almost all of them
coincide with some part of the account I have been giving;
and that if everything that I have said is fully taken into
account, we’ll be able to explain what the view or aspect
of nature was that led each particular author to form his
particular system. It may be that every system of morality
that ever had any reputation in the world has ultimately
come from one or other of the sources that I have been trying
to unfold. Because all those systems are in this way based
on natural principles, they are all to some extent right. But
because many of them are based on a partial and imperfect
view of nature, many of them are in some respects wrong.

In discussing the sources of morals we have to consider

two questions:

(1) What does virtue consist in? That is, what kind of
temperament and tenor of conduct is it that consti-
tutes the excellent and praiseworthy character, the
character that is the natural object of esteem, honour,
and approval?

(2) By what power or faculty in the mind is this
character—whatever it may be—recommended. to us?
That is, how does it come about that the mind prefers

one tenor of conduct to another, calling one ‘right’
and the other ‘wrong’, regarding one as an object of
approval, honour and reward, and the other as an
object of blame, censure and punishment?

We are addressing (1) when we consider whether virtue
consists in •benevolence, as Hutcheson imagines; or in
•acting in a way that is suitable to the different relations we
stand in, as Clarke supposes; or in •the wise and prudent
pursuit of our own real and solid happiness, as others have
thought.

We are addressing (2) when we consider whether the virtu-
ous character—whatever it consists in—is recommended to
us •by self-love, which makes us perceive that this character
in ourselves and in others tends most to promote our own
private interests; or •by reason, which points out to us the
difference right and wrong behaviour in the same way that
it points out the difference between truth and falsehood;
or •by a special power of perception called a ‘moral sense’,
which this virtuous character gratiﬁes and pleases while
the contrary character disgusts and displeases it; or •by
some other drive in human nature, for example some form
of sympathy or the like.

I’ll address (1) in the next section, and (2) in section 3.

Section 2: The different accounts that have been given of the nature of virtue

139

Smith on Moral Sentiments

Systems equating virtue with propriety

The different accounts that have been given of the nature
of virtue, i.e. of what temper of mind makes a character
excellent and praiseworthy, can be put into three classes.
(1) According to some accounts, the virtuous temper of
mind doesn’t consist in any one kind of affection but in
the proper controlling and directing of all our affections,
which may be either virtuous or vicious according to the
objects they pursue and the level of intensity with which they
pursue them. According to these authors, virtue consists in
propriety.

(2) According to others, virtue consists in the judicious
pursuit of our own private interest and happiness, or in the
proper controlling and directing of the selﬁsh affections that
aim solely at this end. In the opinion of these authors, virtue
consists in prudence.

(3) Yet another set of authors make virtue consist only in
the affections that aim at the happiness of others, not in the
ones that aim at our own happiness. According to them, the
only motive that can stamp the character of virtue on any
action is disinterested benevolence.

It’s clear that the character of virtue must either •be
ascribed to all and any our affections when properly con-
trolled and directed, or •be conﬁned to some one class of
them. The big classiﬁcation of our affections is into selﬁsh
and benevolent.
It follows, then, that if the character of
virtue can’t be ascribed to all and any affections when
properly controlled and directed, it must be conﬁned either
to •affections that aim directly at our own private happiness
or •affections that aim directly at the happiness of others.
Thus, if virtue doesn’t consist in (1) propriety, it must consist
either in (2) prudence or in (3) benevolence.
It is hardly
possible to imagine any account of the nature of virtue other
than these three. I shall try to show later on how all the
other accounts that seem different from any of these are

basically equivalent to some one or other of them.

Chapter 1: Systems that make virtue consist in
propriety

According to Plato, Aristotle, and Zeno, virtue consists in the
propriety of conduct, or in the suitableness of the affection
from which we act to the object that arouses it.

(1) In Plato’s system (see Republic Book 4) the soul is
treated as something like a little state or republic, composed
of three different faculties or orders.

(i) The ﬁrst is the judging faculty, which settles not only
what are the proper means for achieving any end but also
what ends are ﬁt to be pursued and how they should be
ordered on the scale of value. Plato rightly called this faculty
‘reason’, and thought it should be the governing mechanism
of the whole. He was clearly taking ‘reason’ to cover not only
the faculty for judging regarding truth and falsehood, but
also the faculty by which we judge whether our desires and
affections are proper or improper.

Plato put the different passions and appetites that are the
natural though sometimes rebellious subjects of this ruling
force into two classes or orders. (ii) Passions based on pride
and resentment, i.e. on what the scholastics call ‘the irascible
part’ of the soul: ambition, animosity, love of honour and
fear of shame, desire for victory, superiority, and revenge. In
short, all the passions that lead us to speak metaphorically of
people as having ‘spirit’ or ‘natural ﬁre’. [Let ‘irascible’ be deﬁned
here by how it is used here. Outside the Platonic context it means ‘angry’
or ‘irritable’.] (iii) Passions based on the love of pleasure, i.e. on
what the scholastics call ‘the concupiscible part’ of the soul:
all the appetites of the body, the love of ease and security,
and of all sensual gratiﬁcations. [The only use for ‘concupiscible’
is this Platonic one. It is pronounced con-kew-pissible.]

140

Smith on Moral Sentiments

Systems equating virtue with propriety

When we interrupt a plan of conduct that (i) reason
prescribes—a plan that we had in our cool hours selected
as the most proper one for us to follow—it is nearly always
because we are being prompted by one or other of those
two different sets of passions, either (ii) by ungovernable
ambition and resentment, or (iii) by the nagging demands of
present ease and pleasure. But though these two classes of
passions are so apt to mislead us, they are still regarded as
necessary parts of human nature—(ii) to defend us against
injuries, to assert our rank and dignity in the world, to make
us aim at what is noble and honourable, and to make us
notice others who act in the same manner; (iii) to provide for
the support and necessities of the body.

According to Plato the essential virtue of prudence in-
volves the strength, acuteness, and perfection of (i) the
governing force, ·reason·. Prudence, he said, consists in
a correct and clear discernment, with the help of general and
scientiﬁc ideas, of the ends that are proper to pursue and of
the means that are proper for achieving them.

When (ii) the ﬁrst set of passions—those of the irascible
part of the soul—are strong and ﬁrm enough to be able,
under the direction of reason, to despise all dangers in the
pursuit of what is honourable and noble, that (·said Plato·)
constitutes the virtue of fortitude and magnanimity. These
passions, according to this system, are more generous and
noble than (iii) the others.
It was thought that they are
often reason’s helpers, checking and restraining the inferior
animal appetites. We’re often angry at ourselves, objects
of our own resentment and indignation, when the love of
pleasure prompts to do something that we disapprove of;
and when this happens (·Plato held·) (ii) the irascible part
of our nature is being called in to assist (i) the rational part
against (iii) the concupiscible part.

When those three parts of our nature are in perfect

harmony with one another, when neither the (ii) irascible nor
the (iii) concupiscible passions ever aim at any gratiﬁcation
that (i) reason doesn’t approve of, and when reason never
commands anything that these two wouldn’t be willing to
perform anyway, this. . . .perfect and complete harmony of
soul constitute the virtue whose Greek name is usually
translated by ‘temperance’, though a better name for it might
be ‘good temperament’, or ‘sobriety and moderation of mind’.
Justice, the last and greatest of the four cardinal virtues
is what you have (according to Plato) when each of those
three faculties of the mind conﬁnes itself to its proper work
without trying to encroach on that of any other, when reason
directs and passion obeys, and when each passion performs
its proper duty and exerts itself towards its proper end easily
and without reluctance, and with the degree of force and
energy that is appropriate for the value of what is being
pursued. . . .

The Greek word that expresses ‘justice’ has several mean-
ings; and I believe that the same is true for the corresponding
word in every other language; so those various meanings
must be naturally linked in some way. •In one sense we
are said to do justice to our neighbour when we don’t
directly harm him or his estate or his reputation. This
is the justice that I discussed earlier, the observance of
which can be extorted by force, and the violation of which
exposes one to punishment. •In another sense we are said
to do justice to our neighbour only if we have for him all the
love, respect, and esteem that his character, his situation,
and his connection with ourselves make it proper for us
to feel, and only if we act accordingly.
It’s in this sense
that we are said to do injustice to a man of merit who is
connected with us if, though we do him no harm, we don’t
exert ourselves to serve him and to place him in the situation
in which the impartial spectator would be pleased to see

141

Smith on Moral Sentiments

Systems equating virtue with propriety

him. [Smith reports on names that have been given to the
kinds of justice corresponding to the two senses by Aristotle
and the Scholastics and by Hugo Grotius, the pioneering
theorist of international law. Then he introduces a third
sense of ‘justice’ which he thinks exists in all languages. It
is a sense in which any mistake in morals or valuation can
be described as not doing justice to something-or-other. He
concludes:] This third sense is evidently what Plato took
justice to be, which is why he holds that justice includes
within itself the perfection of every sort of virtue.

That, then, is Plato’s account of the nature of virtue, or of
the mental temperament that is the proper object of praise
and approval. He says that virtue is the state of mind in
which every faculty stays within its proper sphere without
encroaching on the territory of any other, and does its proper
work with exactly the degree of strength and vigour that
belongs to it. This is obviously just what I have been saying
about the propriety of conduct.

(2) According to Aristotle (Nichomachean Ethics II.5 and
III.6) virtue consists in being habitually central, evenly
balanced, non-extreme, according to right reason.
[Smith:
‘consists in the habit of mediocrity according’ etc.] In his view every
particular virtue lies in a kind of middle between two op-
posite vices—one offending by being too much affected by
something and the other offending by being too little affected
by it. Thus the virtue of fortitude or courage lies in the
middle between the opposite vices of •cowardice and of •wild
rashness, each of which offends through being •too much or
•too little affected by fearful things. The virtue of frugality
lies in a middle between avarice and profusion, each of which
involves •too little or •too much attention to the objects of
self-interest. Similarly, magnanimity lies in the middle
between arrogance and pusillanimity [see note on page 6], each
of which involves a •too extravagant or •too weak sentiment

of one’s own worth and dignity. I need hardly point out that
this account of virtue also corresponds pretty exactly with
what I have already said about the propriety and impropriety
of conduct.

Actually, according to Aristotle (Nichomachean Ethics II.1-
4), virtue consists not so much in those moderate and right
affections as in the habit of this moderation. To understand
this you have to know that •virtue can be considered as
a quality of an •action or of a •person. Considered as the
quality of an •action, it consists in the reasonable moderate-
ness of the affection from which the action comes, whether
or not this disposition is habitual to the person (Aristotle
agreed with this). Considered as the quality of a •person, it
consists in the habit of this reasonable moderateness, i.e.
in its having become the customary and usual disposition
of that person’s mind. Thus, an action that comes from a
passing ﬁt of generosity is undoubtedly a generous action,
but the man who performs it may not be a generous person
because this may be the only generous thing he ever did.
The motive and disposition of heart from which this action
came may have been right and proper; but this satisfactory
frame of mind seems to have come from a passing whim
rather than from anything steady or permanent in the man’s
character, so it can’t reﬂect any great honour on him. . . .
If a single action was sufﬁcient to qualify the person who
performed it as virtuous, the most worthless of mankind
could claim to have all the virtues, because there is no
man who hasn’t occasionally acted with prudence, justice,
temperance, and fortitude! But though single good actions
don’t reﬂect much praise on the person who performs them,
a single vicious action performed by someone whose conduct
is usually proper greatly diminishes and sometimes destroys
altogether our opinion of his virtue. A single action of this
kind shows well enough that his habits are not perfect, and

142

Smith on Moral Sentiments

Systems equating virtue with propriety

that he can’t be depended on as we might have thought he
could, judging by his usual behaviour.

When Aristotle made virtue consist in practical habits
(Magna Moralia I.1), he was probably saying this against
Plato’s thesis that just sentiments and reasonable judgments
concerning what is ﬁt to be done or to be avoided are all that
is needed for the most perfect virtue.
[In the next sentence,
‘science’ is used in its early modern sense of ‘rigorously disciplined,
deductively = “demonstratively” established and organized body of knowl-
edge’.] Virtue, according to Plato, might be considered as a
kind of science; and he thought that anyone will act rightly if
he can see clearly and demonstratively what is right and what
is wrong. Passion might make us act contrary to doubtful
and uncertain opinions but not contrary to plain and evident
judgments. Aristotle disagreed; he held that no conviction
of the understanding can get the better of ingrained habits,
and that good morals arise not from knowledge but from
action.

(3) According to Zeno, the founder of the Stoic doctrine,
every animal is recommended by nature to its own care and
is endowed with a drive of self-love so that it can try to
survive and to keep itself as healthy as it possibly can. (See
Cicero, De Finibus III; Diogenes Laertius, Lives and Opinions
of Eminent Philosophers.) The self-love of man takes in •his
body and all its organs and •his mind and all its faculties
and powers; it wants the preservation and maintenance of all
of these in their best and most perfect condition. Whatever
tends to support •this state of affairs is pointed out to him
by nature as ﬁt to be chosen; and whatever tends to destroy
•it is pointed out as ﬁt to be rejected. Thus

health, strength, agility and ease of body,

as well as physical conveniences that could promote these—
wealth, power, honours, the respect and esteem of
those we live with

—are naturally pointed out to us as eligible, i.e. as things
that it is better to have than to lack. And on the other side,
sickness, inﬁrmity, awkwardness of movement, bodily
pain

as well as all the physical inconveniences that tend to bring
these on—

poverty, lack of authority, the contempt or hatred of
those we live with

—are similarly pointed out to us as things to be shunned
and avoided. Within each of these two contrasting classes of
states there are value orderings. Thus, health seems clearly
preferable to strength, and strength to agility; reputation
to power, and power to riches. And in the second class of
states, sickness is worse than awkwardness of movement,
disgrace is worse than poverty, and poverty is worse than
lack of power. Virtue and the propriety of conduct consist
making our choices in ways that conform to these natural
value-orderings. . . .

Up to here, the Stoic idea of propriety and virtue is not
different from that of Aristotle and the ancient Aristotelians.
·The next paragraph is a statement of the Stoics’ views, not
of mine·.

Among the basic items that nature has recommended
to us as eligible is the prosperity of our family, of our
relatives, of our friends, of our country, of mankind, and
of the universe in general. Nature has also taught us that
because the prosperity of •two is preferable to the prosperity
of •one, the prosperity of •many or of •all must be inﬁnitely
more preferable still. Each of us is only one; so when our
prosperity was inconsistent with that of the whole or of any
considerable part of the whole, we ought to choose to give
way to what is so vastly preferable. All the events in this
world are directed by the providence of a wise, powerful, and
good God; so we can be sure that whatever happens tends

143

Smith on Moral Sentiments

Systems equating virtue with propriety

to the prosperity and perfection of the whole. So if we are
ever poor, sick, or in any other distress, we should ﬁrst of
all do our best—as far as justice and our duty to others will
allow—to rescue ourselves from this disagreeable state of
affairs. But if that turns out to be impossible, we ought to
rest satisﬁed that the order and perfection of the universe
requires that we should in the meantime continue in this
situation. And because the prosperity of the whole should
appear even to us as preferable to such an insigniﬁcant a
part as ourselves, we should at each moment like the state
we are in, whatever it is—that’s what is needed if we are to
maintain the complete propriety of sentiment and conduct
that constitutes the perfection of our nature. Of course if
an opportunity to escape ·from our poverty, sickness, or
whatever· presents itself, it’s our duty to take it. In that case,
it will be evident that the order of the universe no longer
requires us to continue in that state, and the great Director
of the world has plainly called on us to leave it, by clearly
pointing out how to do it. Similarly with the adversity of
our relatives, our friends, our country. If we can, without
violating any more sacred obligation, •prevent or •put an
end to their calamity, it is undoubtedly our duty to do so.
The propriety of action, i.e. the rule that Jupiter has given
us for the direction of our conduct, evidently requires this
of us. But if it’s entirely out of our power to do •either, we
ought to regard this outcome as the most fortunate that
could possibly have happened; because we can be sure that
it tends most to the prosperity and order of the whole, which
was what we ourselves will most desire if we are wise and
equitable. . . .

Epictetus wrote this:

‘In what sense are some things said to be •according
to our nature, and others to be •contrary to it? It
is in the sense in which we consider ourselves as

separated and detached from everything else. ·Here is
an analogue of the point I am making·:
When you consider your right foot as separated and
detached, you can say that it’s according to the nature
of the foot to be always clean. But if you consider it as
a ·functioning· foot and not as detached from the rest
of the body, it’s ﬁtting for it sometimes to trample in
the dirt, sometimes to tread on thorns, perhaps even
to be amputated for the sake of the whole body; and if
those things can’t happen to it, it is no longer a foot.
Now, apply that to how we think about ourselves.
What are you? A man. If you consider yourself as
separated and detached ·from the rest of the universe·,
it is according to your nature to live to old age, and to
be rich and healthy. But if you consider yourself as a
man and as a part of a whole ·universe·, the needs of
that universe may make it ﬁtting for you sometimes
to be sick, sometimes to suffer the inconvenience of
a sea voyage, sometimes to be in want—and perhaps
eventually to die before your time. Why, then, do
you complain? Don’t you know that by this kind
of complaint you stop being a man?, just as the
insistence on the foot’s cleanliness stops it from being
a foot?’

[Smith devotes a long further paragraph to a more detailed
statement of the Stoic’s view that whatever happens to him
is a matter for rejoicing because it must be what God wanted
to happen. In a paragraph after that, he makes the point
that on this Stoic view there is almost no basis for a good
man to prefer any course of events to any other. Continuing:]
The propriety or impropriety of his projects might be of great
consequence to him, but their success or failure couldn’t
matter to him at all. If he preferred some outcomes to others,
if he chose some states of affairs x and rejected others y, it

144

Smith on Moral Sentiments

Systems equating virtue with propriety

was not because he regarded x as in any way intrinsically
better than y, or thought that x would make him happier
than y would; it would be simply because the propriety
of action, the rule that the Gods had given him for the
direction of his conduct, required him to choose x and reject
y. All his affections were absorbed and swallowed up in two
great affections; (a) for the discharge of his own duty, and
(b) for the greatest possible happiness of all rational and
sentient beings. For (b) he relied with perfect conﬁdence on
the wisdom and power of the great Superintendent of the
universe. His only anxiety was about satisfying affection
(a)—not about the outcome but about the propriety of his
own endeavours. . . .

[Now Smith offers three book-pages of development of the
idea that for a good Stoic—one whose passions are under
control and whose only concern is to act rightly—it will
be ‘easy’ to do the right thing in all situations: whether
in prosperity or in adversity, all he has to do is to thank
Jupiter for having treated him in the way He did. Smith
speaks (on the Stoic’s behalf) of the ‘exalted delight’ a good
man has in facing hard times and never acting wrongly. He
moves smoothly on from this to a paragraph leading to a
long discussion of suicide:]

The Stoics seem to have regarded human life as a game
of great skill in which there was also an element of chance
(or what the man in the street takes to be chance). In such
games the stake is commonly a triﬂe, and the whole pleasure
of the game arises from playing well, fairly, and skillfully. If
in such a game a good player has bad luck and happens
to lose, he should be cheerful about this, not seriously sad.
He has made no mistakes, has done nothing that he ought
to be ashamed of; and he has enjoyed the whole pleasure
of the game. And on the other hand if by chance a bad
player happens to win, that success can’t give him much

satisfaction. He is humiliated by the memory of all the
mistakes he has made. Even during the play he is cut
off from much of the pleasure that the game can give by
his constant doubts—unpleasant frightened doubts—about
whether his plays are going to succeed, and his repeated
embarrassment at seeing that he has played badly. The Stoic
view is that human life, with all the advantages that can
possibly accompany it, should be seen as a mere two-penny
stake—something too insigniﬁcant to warrant any anxious
concern. . . .

The Stoics said that human life itself, as well as every
good or bad thing that can accompany it, can properly be
chosen and can properly be rejected, depending on the
circumstances. If your actual situation involves more circum-
stances that are agreeable to nature [Smith’s phrase] than ones
that are contrary to it—more circumstances that are objects
of choice than of rejection—then •life is the proper object of
your choice; if you are to behave rightly, you should remain
in •it. But if your actual situation involves, with no likelihood
of improvement, more circumstances that are contrary to
nature than ones agreeable to it—more circumstances that
are objects of rejection than of choice—then if you are wise
you’ll see •life itself as an object of rejection. You won’t merely
be free to move out of •it; the propriety of conduct, the rule
the Gods have given you for the direction of your conduct,
require you to do so. . . . If your situation is on the whole
disagreeable,. . . .said the Stoics, by all means get out of it.
But do this without, repining, murmuring or complaining.
Stay calm, contented, rejoicing, thanking the gods •who
have generously opened the safe and quiet harbour of death,
always ready to let us in out of the stormy ocean of human
life; •who have prepared this. . . .great asylum. . . .that is
beyond the reach of human rage and injustice, and is large
enough to contain all those who want to retire to it and all

145

Smith on Moral Sentiments

Systems equating virtue with propriety

those who don’t—an asylum that deprives everyone of every
pretence of complaining, or even of imagining that there can
be evils in human life apart from ones that a man may suffer
through his own folly and weakness.

The Stoics, in the few fragments of their philosophy that
have come down to us, sometimes seem to imply that it
would be all right for someone to end his life just because
it had displeased him in some minor way. . . . But that is
misleading: they really held that the question ‘Shall I leave
my life, or remain in it?’ is important, and has to be seriously
deliberated. We ought never to leave our life (they held) until
we are clearly called on to do so by the superintending Power
that gave us our life in the ﬁrst place. But they thought one
might be called on to do so before one had reached old age
and the end of the normal span of human life. Whenever
the superintending Power has managed things in such a
way that our condition in life is, on the whole, something it
is right to reject rather than to choose, then the great rule
of conduct that he has given us requires us to leave our
life. That is when we might be said to hear the awful and
benevolent voice of that divine Being calling on us to do so.
That’s why the Stoics thought that it might be the duty
of a wise man to move out of life though he was perfectly
happy, and the duty of a weak man to remain in it though
he was inevitably miserable. [Smith’s explanation of this can
be put more brieﬂy than he does. The wise man’s life might
be going badly enough to be ‘a proper object of rejection’
although he was wise enough to be perfectly happy because
the universe was unrolling as it should; the weak man’s life
might be going well enough to make it wrong for him to reject
it, although he wasn’t smart enough to avail himself of his
opportunities and was therefore unhappy with a life that
was mainly going well for him. Smith supports this with a
reference to Cicero’s De Finibus III.]

[Then two book-pages on the historical background of
the Stoic doctrine. Stoicism ﬂourished, Smith says, at
a time when the Greek city-states were at war with one
another; the war was extraordinarily cruel and destructive,
and most of the states were too small to offer their citizens
much security.
In this context, Stoicism provided Greek
‘patriots and heroes’ with something that could support
them if they eventually had to face slavery, torture, or death.
Smith compares this with the ‘death-song’ that an ‘American
savage’ prepared in advance as something he could deﬁantly
sing while being tortured to death. The philosophies of
Plato and Aristotle also offered ‘a death-song that the Greek
patriots and heroes might use on the proper occasions’, but
Smith says that ‘the Stoics had prepared by far the most
animated and spirited song’. Writing about the ancient Greek
philosophers generally, and not just the Stoics, Smith says
memorably:] The few fragments that have come down to
us of what the ancient philosophers had written on these
subjects constitute one of the most instructive remains of
antiquity, and also one of the most interesting. The spirit
and manliness of their doctrines make a wonderful contrast
with the desponding, plaintive, and whining tone of some
modern systems. . . .

[Smith remarks at length that suicide ‘seems never to
have been common among the Greeks’ and that it ‘appears
to have been much more prevalent among the proud Romans
than it ever was among the lively, ingenious, and accommo-
dating Greeks’. He discusses some individual Greek cases,
and questions the reliability of the reports. In the time of the
Roman emperors, he says, ‘this method of dying seems to
have been for a long time perfectly fashionable’—an exercise
of vanity and exhibitionism!]

The push towards suicide, the impulse that offers to
teach us that the violent action of taking one’s own life

146

Smith on Moral Sentiments

Systems equating virtue with propriety

ought sometimes to be applauded and approved, seems to
be purely something that philosophy has produced. When
Nature is sound and healthy she never seems to prompt us
to suicide.
It’s true that there is a species of melancholy
(a disease to which human nature. . . .is unhappily subject)
that seems to be accompanied with what one might call
an irresistible desire for self-destruction. This disease has
often driven its wretched victims to this fatal extreme—often
when their external circumstances were highly prosperous,
and sometimes in deﬁance of serious and deeply ingrained
sentiments of religion. People who perish in this miserable
way are proper objects not of censure but of pity. To try to
punish them, when they are beyond the reach of all human
punishment, is as unjust as it is absurd. . . . Nature, when
sound and healthy, prompts us to •avoid distress on all
occasions, and on many occasions to •defend ourselves
against it, even at the risk—or indeed the certainty—of
dying in the attempt. But when we haven’t been able to
defend ourselves from distress but haven’t died trying, no
natural impulse—no regard for the approval of the imagined
impartial spectator, i.e. for the judgment of the man within
the breast—seems to call on us to escape from distress
by destroying ourselves. When we are driven to decide on
suicide, what drives us is only our awareness of our own
weakness, of our own inability to bear the calamity in a
properly manly and ﬁrm manner. . . .

The two doctrines on which the entire fabric of Stoical

morality is based are these:

(i) disregard for ·the difference between· life and death,

and

(ii) complete submission to the order of Providence, com-
plete contentment with every outcome that the current
of human affairs could possibly cast up.

The independent and spirited (though often harsh) Epictetus

can be seen as the great apostle of (i), and the mild, humane,
benevolent Antoninus is the great apostle of (ii).

(i) After a life with many vicissitudes, Epictetus was
banished from Rome and Athens, and lived in exile knowing
that at any moment he could receive a death sentence from
the tyrannical emperor who had banished him. His way
of preserving his tranquillity was to develop in his mind a
strong sense that human life is insigniﬁcant. ·In his writings·
he never exults so much (and so his eloquence is never
so animated) as when he is representing the futility and
nothingness of all life’s pleasures and all its pains.

(ii) The good-natured Emperor ·Antoninus· (known in
philosophy as Marcus Aurelius) was the absolute ruler of the
whole civilized world, and certainly had no special reason
to complain about the share of good things the world had
given him. But he delights in expressing his contentment
with the ordinary course of things, pointing out beauties
even in things where ordinary observers are not apt to see
any. There is a propriety and even an engaging grace, he
observes, in old age as well as in youth; and the weakness
and decrepitude of age are as suitable to nature as is youth’s
bloom and vigour. And it’s just as proper for old age to end
in death as it is for childhood to end in youth and for youth
to end in manhood. In another place he writes this:

‘A physician may order some man to ride on horse-
back, or to have cold baths, or to walk barefooted; and
we ought to see Nature, the great director and physi-
cian of the universe, as ordering that some man shall
have a disease, or have a limb amputated, or suffer
the loss of a child. From the prescriptions of ordinary
physicians the patient swallows many a bitter dose
of medicine, and undergoes many painful operations,
gladly submitting to all this in the hope—and that’s
all it is: hope—that health may be the result. Well, the

147

Smith on Moral Sentiments

Systems equating virtue with propriety

patient can in the same way hope that the harshest
prescriptions of the great Physician of nature will
in the same way contribute to his own health, his
own ﬁnal prosperity and happiness; and he can be
quite sure that they don’t merely •contribute but •are
indispensably necessary to the health, prosperity and
happiness of the universe, to the furtherance and
advancement of Jupiter’s great plan. If they weren’t,
the universe would never have produced them; its
all-wise Architect and Director wouldn’t have allowed
them to happen. The parts of the universe are exactly
ﬁtted together, and all contribute to composing one
immense and connected system; so every part, even
the most insigniﬁcant parts, of the sequence of events
is an essential part of that great chain of causes and
effects that never began and will never end—a part
that is necessary not only for the universe’s prosperity
but also for its very survival. Anyone who doesn’t
cordially embrace whatever happens to him, is sorry
that it has happened to him, wishes that it hadn’t
happened to him, is someone who wants as far as he
can to stop the motion of the universe, to break that
great series of events through which the universal
system is continued and preserved, and for some little
convenience of his own to disorder and discompose
the whole machine of the world. . . .’

From these high-minded doctrines the Stoics, or at least
some of them, tried to deduce all the rest of their paradox-
ical philosophy. ·I shall call attention to just two of their
paradoxical doctrines·.

A: The wise Stoic tries to enter into the views of the
great Superintendent of the universe, and to see things
in the light in which that divine Being sees them. But to
this great Superintendent all the different events that the

course of his providence may bring forth—from the smallest
to the greatest, e.g. from the bursting of a bubble to the
bursting of a world, are •equally parts of the great chain
that he has predestined from all eternity, are •equally the
effects of the same unerring wisdom, of the same universal
and boundless benevolence. So all those different events
must be on a par for the Stoic wise man too. One little
department within those events has been assigned to him,
and he has some little management and direction of them.
In this department he tries to act as properly as he can, and
to conduct himself according to the orders that (he thinks)
he has been given. But he has no anxious or passionate
concern over the success or failure of his own most faithful
endeavours. Regarding the little system that has been to
some extent committed to his care, it means nothing to him
whether it has the highest prosperity or is totally destroyed.
If that outcome—•prosperity or •destruction—had depended
on him, he would have chosen •one and rejected •the other.
But it doesn’t depend on him; so he trusts to a wisdom
greater than his, and is satisﬁed that the outcome, whatever
it may be, is the one he would have devoutly wished for if he
had known all the facts about how things are interconnected.
Whatever he does under the inﬂuence and direction of those
principles is equally perfect; snapping his ﬁngers is as
meritorious, as worthy of praise and admiration, as laying
down his life in the service of his country. . . .

B: Just as those who arrive at this state of perfection are
equally happy, so all those who fall short of it by any amount,
however small, are equally miserable. In the Stoics’ view,
just as

a man who is only an inch below the surface of the
water can’t breathe any more than someone who is a
hundred yards down,

so also

148

Smith on Moral Sentiments

Systems equating virtue with propriety

a man who hasn’t completely subdued all his private,
partial, and selﬁsh passions, who has an earnest
desire for anything other than universal happiness,
who hasn’t completely emerged from that abyss of
misery and disorder that he has been in because of
his anxiety for the satisfaction of those private, partial,
and selﬁsh passions, can’t breathe the free air of
liberty and independence, can’t enjoy the security and
happiness of the wise man, any more than someone
who is enormously far from that situation. [Here and in
what follows, ‘partial’ means ‘not impartial’, or ‘biased’.]

Just as all the actions of the wise man are perfect, equally
perfect, so all the actions of the man who hasn’t arrived
at this supreme wisdom are faulty, and, according to some
of the Stoics, equally faulty. One truth can’t be more true
than another, and one falsehood can’t be more false than
another; and similarly one honourable action can’t be more
honourable than another, nor can one shameful action be
more shameful than another. . . . A man who has killed a
cock improperly and without a sufﬁcient reason is morally
on a par with a man who has murdered his father.

The ﬁrst of those two paradoxes seems bad enough,
but the second is obviously too absurd to deserve seri-
ous consideration.
It’s so absurd, indeed, that one sus-
pects that it must have been somewhat misunderstood or
misrepresented.
I can’t believe that men such as Zeno
or Cleanthes—men whose eloquence was said to be both
simple and very uplifting—could be the authors of these
two paradoxes of Stoicism, or of most of the others. The
others are in general mere impertinent quibbles, which do
so little honour to Stoicism that I shall say no more about
them. I’m inclined to attribute them to Chrysippus. He was
indeed a disciple and follower of Zeno and Cleanthes; but
from what we know of him he seems to have been a mere

argumentative pedant, with no taste or elegance of any kind.
He may have been the ﬁrst who put Stoicism into the form
of a scholastic or technical system of artiﬁcial deﬁnitions,
divisions, and subdivisions; which may be one the most
effective ways of extinguishing whatever good sense there is
in a moral or metaphysical doctrine! It is easy to believe that
such a man could have construed too literally some of the
lively expressions that his masters used in describing the
happiness of the man of perfect virtue and the unhappiness
of whoever fell short of that character.

[Smith says that the Stoics in general seem to have
allowed that there are different degrees of wrongness of
behaviour, and he reports some technical terms that were
used in this connection by Cicero and Seneca. None of this
is needed for what comes next. Having said that the main
lines of the moral philosophies of Plato and of Aristotle are
in line with his own views, Smith now implies that Stoicism
is not. But he doesn’t put it like that. Rather, he says:]

The plan and system that Nature has sketched out for
our conduct seems to be altogether different from that of the
Stoic philosophy.

The events that immediately affect the little department in
which we ourselves have some management and direction—
the events that immediately affect ourselves, our friends,
our country—are the ones that Nature •makes us care
about most and •makes the main causes of our desires and
aversions, our hopes and fears, our joys and sorrows. When
those passions are too violent (as they are apt to be), Nature
has provided a proper remedy and correction. The real or
even the imaginary presence of the impartial spectator, the
authority of the man within the breast, is always at hand to
awe our passions into coming down to a properly moderate
level.

If despite our best efforts all the events that can affect our

149

Smith on Moral Sentiments

Systems equating virtue with propriety

Although the reasonings of philosophy may confound
and perplex the understanding, they can’t break down the
necessary connection Nature has established between causes
and their effects. The causes that naturally arouse our
desires and aversions, our hopes and fears, our joys and
sorrows, produce their proper and necessary effects on each
individual, according to his actual level of sensitivity, and all
the reasonings of Stoicism can’t stop that. However, the judg-
ments of the man within the breast might be considerably
affected by those reasonings, and that great inmate might be
taught by them to attempt to overawe all our private, partial,
and selﬁsh affections into a more or less perfect tranquillity.
Directing the judgments of this inmate is the great purpose
of all systems of morality. There’s no doubt that the Stoic
philosophy had great inﬂuence on the character and conduct
of its followers; and though it might sometimes have incited
them to unnecessary violence, its general tendency was to
stir them up to perform actions of heroic magnanimity and
extensive benevolence.

(4)

[This follows the treatment of (3) Stoicism which began on
page 143.] Besides these ancient systems there are some
modern ones according to which virtue consists in propriety,
i.e. in the suitableness of •the affection from which we act to
•the cause or object that arouses it. Clark’s system places
virtue in

little department turn out to be unfortunate and disastrous,
Nature hasn’t left us without consolation. We can get comfort
not only from the complete approval of the man within the
breast but also from a still nobler and more generous source,
namely

a ﬁrm reliance on, and a reverential submission to,
the benevolent wisdom which directs all the events
of human life, and which (we can be sure) would
never have allowed those misfortunes to happen if
they hadn’t been utterly necessary for the good of the
whole.

But Nature has not prescribed this lofty thought to us as the
great business and occupation of our lives! She merely points
it out to us as consolation in our misfortunes. The Stoic
philosophy prescribes this thought as though turning it over
in our minds were the main thing we have to do with our lives.
That philosophy teaches us that we are not to care earnestly
and deeply about anything except •the good order of our own
minds, the propriety of our own choosings and rejections,
and •events that concern a department where we don’t and
shouldn’t have any sort of management or direction, namely
the department of the great Superintendent of the universe.
By

•the perfect passiveness that it prescribes to us, by
•trying not merely to moderate but to eradicate all our
private, partial, and selﬁsh affections, by
•not allowing us to have feelings for what happens
to ourselves, our friends, our country—not even the
sympathetic and reduced passions of the impartial
spectator,

Stoicism tries to make us entirely indifferent and uncon-
cerned about the success or failure of everything that Nature
has prescribed to us as the proper business and occupation
of our lives.

150

Smith on Moral Sentiments

A system equating virtue with prudence

•acting according to the relations of things, i.e. in
•regulating our conduct according to whether a pro-
posed action would ﬁt, or be congruous with, certain
things or certain relations;

Wollaston’s system places virtue in

•acting according to the truth of things, according to
their proper nature and essence, i.e. •treating them
as what they really are and not as what they are not;

Lord Shaftesbury’s system identiﬁes virtue with

•maintaining a proper balance of the affections, allow-
ing no passion to go beyond its proper sphere.

These theories are all more or less inaccurate presentations
of the same fundamental idea.

None of those systems gives—none of them even claims
to give—any precise or distinct criterion that will guide us in
discovering or judging this ﬁtness or propriety of affections.
The only place where that precise and distinct measure can
be found is in the sympathetic feelings of the impartial and
well-informed spectator.

Each of those systems gives a description of virtue that is
certainly correct as far as it goes. (I should really say ‘gives or
intends to give’—some of the modern authors don’t express
themselves very well.) There’s no virtue without propriety,
and wherever there is propriety some degree of approval is
due. But this is an incomplete account of virtue. Propriety
is indeed an essential ingredient in every virtuous action,
but it’s not always the sole ingredient. Beneﬁcent actions
have in them another quality which seems to entitle them
not only to approval but also to reward. None the systems I
have mentioned accounts either easily or sufﬁciently for •the
superior degree of esteem that seems due to such actions, or
for •the variety of sentiments that they naturally arouse. And
their description of vice is also incomplete in a similar way.

Impropriety is a necessary ingredient in every vicious action,
but it isn’t always the sole ingredient. Deliberate actions that
cause real harm to those we live with are not merely improper
but have a special quality of their own that seems to make
them deserve not only disapproval but punishment, and to
be objects not only of dislike but of resentment and revenge.
None of those systems easily and sufﬁciently accounts for
the higher degree of detestation that we feel for such actions.
(·Also, impropriety doesn’t necessarily involve immorality·:
there is often the highest degree of absurdity and impropriety
in actions that are harmless and insigniﬁcant.)

Chapter 2: A system that makes virtue consist in
prudence

The most ancient of the systems that make virtue consist in
prudence, and of which any considerable record has come
down to us, is that of Epicurus. He is said to have borrowed
all the leading principles of his philosophy from some of
his predecessors, especially Aristippus; but that’s what his
enemies said, and it’s probable that at least his way of
applying those principles was altogether his own.

According to Epicurus, bodily pleasure and pain are
the sole ultimate objects of natural desire and aversion.
(Cicero, De Finibus I; Diogenes Laertius, Lives and Opinions
of Eminent Philosophers, I.10.) Of course it might sometimes
seem that some pleasure should be avoided; but that is
only because by enjoying it we would be losing some greater
pleasure or incurring some pain that wouldn’t have been
compensated for by the pleasure that led to it. And sim-
ilarly for cases where it seems that some pain should be
chosen—as a way of avoiding some other worse pain, or
of getting a pleasure that would more than make up for
the pain. Given those explanations, Epicurus thought it

151

Smith on Moral Sentiments

A system equating virtue with prudence

to be really obvious—and not in need of proof—that bodily
pain and pleasure are always natural objects of desire and
aversion, and that they are the only ultimate objects of
those passions. According to him, anything else that is
either desired or avoided is so because of its tendency to
produce one or other of those sensations. •The tendency to
procure pleasure makes power and riches desirable, as the
contrary tendency to produce pain makes poverty an object
of aversion. •Honour and reputation are valued because the
esteem and love of those we live with are a great help in
getting us pleasure and defending us from pain. •Disgrace
and notoriety are to be avoided because the hatred, contempt
and resentment of those we lived with destroys all security
and lays us wide open to the greatest bodily evils.

[The next two pages expound the views of Epicurus, and that’s all
they do. Smith resumes speaking for himself in the paragraph starting
‘Such is the doctrine of Epicurus. . . ’ on page 153.]

All the pleasures and pains of the •mind are ultimately
derived from those of the •body. The mind is happy when
it thinks of the past pleasures of the body and hopes for
more to come; and it is miserable when it thinks of pains
that the body has endured, and dreads the same or greater
thereafter.

But the pleasures and pains of the mind, though ulti-
mately derived from those of the body, are vastly greater
than their originals. The body feels only the sensation of the
•present instant, whereas the mind also feels the •past by
memory and the •future by anticipation, and consequently
suffers and enjoys much more. When we are suffering the
greatest bodily pain, we’ll always ﬁnd—if we attend to it—that
what chieﬂy torments us is not the suffering of the present
instant but either the agonizing memory of the past or the
even more horrible fear of the future. The pain of each
instant, considered by itself and cut off from everything that

happens before or after it, is a triﬂe, not worth attending
to. Yet that is all that the body can ever be said to suffer.
Similarly, when we enjoy the greatest pleasure we’ll always
ﬁnd that the bodily sensation—the sensation of the present
instant—creates only a small part of our happiness, and that
our enjoyment mainly comes from the cheerful recollection
of the past or the still more joyous anticipation of the future,
so that the mind always contributes by far the largest share
of the entertainment.

Since our happiness and misery mainly depend on the
mind, if this part of our nature is well disposed, and our
thoughts and opinions are as they should be, it doesn’t mat-
ter much how our body is affected. Though in great bodily
pain, we can still enjoy a considerable share of happiness
if our reason and judgment keep the upper hand. We can
entertain ourselves with memories of past pleasures and
hopes for future ones; and we can soften the severity of our
pains by bearing in mind what it is that at this moment we
have to suffer. Thinking about this can lessen our suffering
in any of four ways by leading us to ponder four thoughts.
(1) All I am compelled to suffer is merely the bodily sensation,
the pain of the present instant, and that can’t be great.
(2) Any agony that I suffer from the fear that my pain will
continue is an effect of an opinion of my mind, and I can
correct that by having sentiments that are more correct. (3) If
my pains are violent they probably won’t last long; and if they
go on for long they will probably be moderate, and will be
interrupted from time to time. (4) Death is always available
to me as an option; it would put an end to all sensation,
whether of pain or of pleasure, and can’t be regarded as an
evil. When we exist, death doesn’t; and when death exists,
we don’t; so death can’t matter to us.

If the actual sensation of positive pain is, in itself, •so
little to be feared, the sensation of pleasure is •still less to

152

Smith on Moral Sentiments

A system equating virtue with prudence

be desired. The sensation of pleasure is naturally much
less forceful [Smith: ‘pungent’] than that of pain; so if pain can
take so little from the happiness of a well-disposed mind,
pleasure could add hardly anything to it. When the body
is free from pain and the mind from fear and anxiety, the
added sensation of bodily pleasure can’t matter much; it
might diversify someone’s mental content but can’t properly
be said to increase the happiness of his situation.

Thus, the most perfect state of human nature, the most
complete happiness that man is capable of enjoying, is bodily
ease and security or tranquillity of mind. To obtain this great
end of natural desire is the sole object of all the virtues,
which are desirable not on their own account but because
of their tendency to bring about this situation ·of ease and
tranquillity·.

Take the case of prudence. It is the source and energiser
of all the virtues, but it isn’t desirable on its own account.
That careful and laborious and circumspect state of mind—
always on the watch for even the most distant consequences
of every action—can’t be pleasant or agreeable for its own
sake. What makes it valuable is its tendency to procure the
greatest goods and to keep off the greatest evils.

Similarly with temperance—curbing and restraining our
natural passions for enjoyment, which is the job of temper-
ance, can’t ever be desirable for its own sake. The whole
value of this virtue arises from its utility, from its enabling us
to postpone the present enjoyment for the sake of a greater
to come, or to avoid a greater pain that might ensue from it.
Temperance, in short, is nothing but prudence with regard
to pleasure.

The situations that fortitude would often lead us into—
keeping hard at work, enduring pain, risking danger or
death—are surely even further from being objects of natural
desire. They are chosen only to avoid greater evils. We

submitted to hard work in order to avoid the greater shame
and pain of poverty, and we risk danger and death •in
defence of our liberty and property, which are means and
instruments of pleasure and happiness, or •in defence of our
country, the safety of which necessarily includes our own
safety. Fortitude enables us to do all this cheerfully, as the
best that is possible in our present situation; it’s really just
prudence—good judgment and presence of mind in properly
appreciating pain, labour, and danger, always choosing the
less in order to avoid the greater.

It is the same case with justice. Abstaining from taking
something that belongs to someone else isn’t desirable on
its own account: it’s not certain that it would be better for
you if I kept this item of mine than that you should possess
it. But you oughtn’t to take any of my belongings from
me because if you do you’ll provoke the resentment and
indignation of mankind. ·If that happens·, the security and
tranquillity of your mind will be destroyed. You’ll be ﬁlled
with fear and confusion by the thought of the punishment
that you will imagine men are always ready to inﬂict on
you. . . . The other sort of justice that consists in giving
good help to various people according to their relations to
us—as neighbours, kinsmen, friends, benefactors, superiors,
or equals—is recommended by the same reasons. Acting
properly in all these different relations brings us the esteem
and love of those we live with, and doing otherwise arouses
their contempt and hatred. By the one we naturally secure,
and by the other we necessarily endanger, our own ease
and tranquillity, which are the great and ultimate objects
of all our desires. So the whole virtue of justice—the most
important of all the virtues—is no more than discreet and
prudent conduct with regard to our neighbours.

Such is the doctrine of Epicurus concerning the nature
of virtue. It may seem extraordinary that this philosopher,

153

Smith on Moral Sentiments

A system equating virtue with prudence

who was said to be personally very likeable, should have
overlooked the fact that

•whatever those virtues (or the contrary vices) tend to
produce in the way of bodily ease and security, the
sentiments they naturally arouse in others are objects
of a much more passionate desire (or aversion) than
all their other consequences; that
•every well-disposed mind attaches more value to being
likeable, being respectworthy, being a proper object
of esteem, than to all the ease and security that may
come from such love, respect, and esteem; that
•being odious, being contemptible, being a proper
object of indignation, is more dreadful than any bodily
suffering that can come from such hatred, contempt,
or indignation;

and that consequently our desire to be virtuous and our
aversion to being vicious can’t arise from any concern for the
bodily effects that either virtue or vice is likely to produce.

There’s no doubt that this system is utterly inconsistent
with the one I have been trying to establish. But it is
easy enough to see what way of looking at things gave
Epicurus’s system its plausibility. The Author of nature
has wisely arranged things so that, even in this life, virtue
is ordinarily. . . .the surest and readiest means of obtaining
both safety and advantage. Our success or failure in our
projects must depend largely on whether people commonly
have a good or a bad opinion of us, and on whether those we
live with are generally disposed to help us or oppose us. But
the best, surest, easiest, most readily available way to get
people to think well of us is to deserve their good opinion,
to be proper objects of their approval. . . . So the practice of
virtue is in general very advantageous to our interests, and
the practice of vice is contrary to our interests; and these
facts undoubtedly stamp an additional beauty and propriety

on virtue and a new ugliness and impropriety on vice. In
this way temperance, magnanimity, justice, and beneﬁcence
come to be approved of not only for what they essentially are
but also for their role as very real prudence. And similarly,
the contrary vices of intemperance, pusillanimity, injustice,
and either malevolence or sordid selﬁshness come to be
disapproved of not only for what they essentially are but also
for their role as short-sighted folly and weakness. It seems
that when Epicurus considered any virtue he attended only
to this kind of propriety. It’s the one that is most apt to occur
to those who are trying to persuade others to behave well.
When someone’s conduct (and also perhaps things he says)
make it clear that the natural beauty of virtue isn’t likely
to have much effect on him, how can he be moved in the
direction of better behaviour except by showing him the folly
of his conduct, and how much he himself is likely eventually
to suffer by it?

By reducing all the •different virtues to this •one species
of propriety, Epicurus did something that comes naturally
to all men but is especially beloved of philosophers as a way
of displaying their ingenuity! I am talking about the practice
of explaining all appearances in terms of as few causes or
sources as possible. And it’s clear that he was taking this
even further when he equated all the primary objects of
natural desire and aversion with bodily pleasures and pains.
This great patron of atomism, who so enjoyed deducing •all
the powers and qualities of bodies from •the most obvious
and familiar of them—namely, the shapes, motions, and
arrangements of the small parts of matter—no doubt felt a
similar satisfaction when he explained •all the sentiments
and passions of the mind in terms of •those that are most
obvious and familiar.

The system of Epicurus agrees with those of Plato, Aristo-
tle, and Zeno, in making virtue consist in acting in the most

154

Smith on Moral Sentiments

Systems that equate virtue with benevolence

suitable manner to obtain the primary objects of natural
desire. It differs from all of them in two other respects—its
account of what the primary objects of natural desire are,
and its account of the excellence of virtue, i.e. of why virtue
ought to be esteemed.

According to Epicurus the primary objects of natural
desire are bodily pleasure and pain, and that’s all; whereas
the other three philosophers held that many other objects are
ultimately desirable for their own sakes—e.g. knowledge, and
happiness for our relatives, our friends, and our country.

Also, according to Epicurus virtue doesn’t deserve to be
pursued for its own sake, and isn’t one of the ultimate objects
of natural appetite. He held that virtue is something to be
chosen only because of its tendency to prevent pain and
to procure ease and pleasure. In the opinion of the other
three philosophers, on the other hand, virtue is desirable
not merely •as a means for procuring the other primary
objects of natural desire but •as something that is in itself
more valuable than all of them. Because man is born for
action, they held, his happiness must consist not merely in
the agreeableness of his passive sensations but also in the
propriety of his active efforts.

Chapter 3: Systems that make virtue consist in
benevolence

The system that makes virtue consist in benevolence is of
great antiquity, though I don’t think it is as old as any of
the ones I have been discussing. It seems to have been the
doctrine of the greater part of those philosophers who, in the
time of Augustus and shortly thereafter, called themselves
‘Eclectics’ and claimed to be following mainly the opinions
of Plato and Pythagoras—which is why they are often called
‘later Platonists’.

In the divine nature, according to these authors, benevo-
lence or love is the sole driver of action, and directs the
exercise of all the other attributes. God employed his
•wisdom in ﬁnding out the means for bringing about the ends
that his goodness suggested, and he exercised his inﬁnite
•power in bringing them about. But •benevolence was the
supreme and governing attribute, and the other attributes
were subservient to it. The ultimate source of the whole
excellence. . . .of God’s operations is his benevolence. The
whole perfection and virtue of the human mind consists in its
•having some resemblance to, some share in, the perfections
of God, and therefore in its •being ﬁlled with the same drive
of benevolence and love that inﬂuences all the actions of the
Deity. The only actions of men that were truly praiseworthy,
or could claim any merit in God’s sight, are ones that ﬂowed
from benevolence. It is only by actions of charity and love
that we can suitably imitate the conduct of God, expressing
our humble and devout admiration of his inﬁnite perfections.
Only by fostering in our own minds the divine drive towards
benevolence can we make our own affections resemble more
closely God’s holy attributes, thereby becoming more proper
objects of his love and esteem; until at last we arrive at
the state that this philosophy is trying to get us to, namely
immediate converse and communication with God.

This system was greatly admired by many ancient fathers
of the Christian church, and after the Reformation it was
adopted by several ·protestant· divines—eminently pious
and learned men, likeable men—especially Ralph Cudworth,
Henry More, and John Smith of Cambridge. But there can be
no doubt that of all this system’s patrons, ancient or modern,
the late Francis Hutcheson was incomparably the most
acute, the clearest, the most philosophical, and—the most
important point—the soberest and most judicious. [Hutcheson
died, aged 52, a dozen years before Smith wrote this.]

Systems that equate virtue with benevolence

Many aspects of human nature support the idea that
virtue consists in benevolence. I have pointed out that proper
benevolence

•is the most graceful and agreeable of all the affections,
that
•it is recommended to us by a double sympathy, that
•because it necessarily tends to do good, it is a proper
object of gratitude and reward,

and that for all these reasons

•it appears to our natural sentiments to have a higher
merit than any other virtue.

I have also remarked that even the excesses [Smith writes
‘weaknesses’; evidently a slip] of benevolence are not disagreeable
to us, whereas those of every other passion are always
extremely disgusting. Everyone loathes excessive malice,
excessive selﬁshness, and excessive resentment; but the
most excessive indulgence even of partial friendship is not
so offensive. . . .

Just as benevolence gives to the actions it produces
a beauty that is superior to all others, so the lack
of benevolence—and even more the contrary inclination,
malevolence—gives to all its manifestations in behaviour
a special ugliness all of its own. Pernicious actions are often
punishable simply because they show a lack of sufﬁcient
attention to the happiness of our neighbour.

Besides all this, Hutcheson observed that when an action
that was supposed to have come from benevolent affections
turns out to have had some other motive, our sense of
the merit of this action is lessened in proportion to how
much inﬂuence this motive is believed to have had over the
(Hutcheson, Inquiry Concerning Virtue, sections 1
action.
and 2 [thus Smith’s reference; actually, that’s the title of a work by
Shaftesbury; Smith presumably meant to refer to Hutcheson’s Inquiry
into the original of our idea of Virtue].)
If an action supposed to

come from •gratitude turns out to have arisen from •an
expectation of some new favour, or if an action supposed
to have come from •public spirit turns out to have been
motivated by a •hope for reward-money, such a discovery
will entirely destroy all notion of merit or praiseworthiness in
either of these actions. Thus, the mixture of any selﬁsh
motive. . . .lessens or abolishes the merit that the action
would otherwise have had, and Hutcheson thought that
this made it obvious that virtue must consist in pure and
disinterested benevolence alone.

And when an action that is commonly supposed to come
from a selﬁsh motive turns out to have arisen from a benev-
olent one, that greatly enhances our sense of the action’s
merit. . . . This fact seemed to Hutcheson to be a further
conﬁrmation of his thesis that benevolence is the only thing
that can make any action virtuous.

And ﬁnally he thought that the correctness of his account
of virtue is shown by the fact that in all the disputes of
casuists [= ‘theorists of applied ethics’] concerning the rectitude
of conduct, the public good is the standard to which they
constantly refer, thereby all accepting that whatever tends
to promote the happiness of mankind is right and laudable
and virtuous, and whatever tends to go against it is wrong,
blameworthy, and vicious.
In debates about passive obe-
dience and the right of resistance, the sole disagreement
among men of sense concerns the answer to this:

When privileges are invaded, which response is likely
to bring the greater evils—universal submission or
temporary insurrection?

As for this question:

Would the upshot that tended most to the happiness
of mankind be the morally good one?

—nobody, Hutcheson said, even bothered to ask it!

156

Smith on Moral Sentiments

Systems that equate virtue with benevolence

Since benevolence is the only motive that can make an
action virtuous, the greater the benevolence that an action
shows the greater is the praise that it deserves.

The actions that aim at the happiness of a great commu-
nity, because they show a more enlarged benevolence than
do actions aiming only at the happiness of a smaller system,
are correspondingly more virtuous. So the most virtuous
of all affections is the one that embraces as its object the
happiness of all thinking beings; and the least virtuous of
the affections that could be called ‘virtuous’ at all is the
one that aims no further than at the happiness of some one
individual—a son, a brother, a friend. [See note about ‘affection’
on page 116.]

The perfection of virtue, ·Hutcheson held·, consists in

•directing all our actions to promote the greatest possi-
ble good,
•submitting all inferior affections to the desire for the
general happiness of mankind,
•regarding oneself as merely one of the many, whose
prosperity is to be pursued no further than is consis-
tent with the prosperity of the whole.

Self-love can never be virtuous in any degree or in any direc-
tion, ·Hutcheson said·. When it obstructs the general good,
it is vicious. When its only effect is to make the individual
take care of his own happiness, it is merely innocent—not
deserving of praise or blame. A benevolent action is especially
virtuous if it is performed in deﬁance of some strong motive
from self-interest, because that demonstrate the strength
and vigour of that person’s benevolent drive.

Hutcheson was so far from allowing self-love ever to be a
motive of virtuous actions that, according to him, the merit
of a benevolent action is lessened if the person wanted the
pleasure of self-approval, the comfortable applause of his
own conscience. He saw this as a selﬁsh motive which, so

far as it contributed to any action, showed the weakness ·in
that person at that time· of the pure and disinterested benev-
olence that is the only thing that can make a human action
virtuous. Yet in the common judgments of mankind, this
concern for the approval of our own minds, far from being
considered as reducing the virtue of any action, is looked on
as the only motive that deserves the label ‘virtuous’.

Well, that is how virtue is described in this likeable
system, a system that has a special tendency •to nourish and
support the noblest and most agreeable of all affections—and
not only •to stop self-love from acting unjustly but also to
some extent •to discourage self-love altogether by implying
that it can never reﬂect any honour on those who are
inﬂuenced by it.

Some of the other systems I have described don’t sufﬁ-
ciently explain what gives the supreme virtue of benevolence
its special excellence, whereas this system of Hutcheson’s
seems to have the opposite defect, of not sufﬁciently ex-
plaining why we approve of the inferior virtues of prudence,
vigilance, circumspection, temperance, constancy, ﬁrmness.
The only feature of an affection that this system attends to at
all is its aim, the beneﬁcent or harmful effects that it tends
to produce. Its propriety or impropriety, its suitableness and
unsuitableness to the cause that arouses it, is completely
ignored.

Also, a regard for our own private happiness and interest
It is
seems often to be a praiseworthy motive for action.
generally supposed that self-interested motives are what lead
us to develop the habits of economy, industry, discretion,
attention, and application of thought, and these are taken by
everyone to be praiseworthy qualities that deserve everyone’s
esteem and approval.
It’s true of course that an action
that ought to arise from a benevolent affection seems to
have its beauty spoiled by an admixture of a selﬁsh motive;

157

Smith on Moral Sentiments

Systems that equate virtue with benevolence

but that isn’t because self-love can never be the motive
of a virtuous action, but only because in the given case
the benevolent motive appears to lack its proper degree of
strength and to be altogether unsuitable to its object. The
person’s character seems to be imperfect, and on the whole
to deserve blame rather than praise. When an action for
which self-love alone ought to be a sufﬁcient motive has an
admixture of benevolence in its motivation, that isn’t so likely
to diminish our sense of the action’s propriety or of the virtue
of the person who performs it. We’re not ready to suspect
anyone of being defective in selﬁshness!. . . . But if we really
believe, of any man, that if it weren’t for a concern for his
family and his friends he wouldn’t take proper care of his
health, his life, or his fortune,. . . .that would undoubtedly be
a failing, though one of those likeable failings that make a
person an object of pity rather than of contempt or hatred.
It would somewhat lessen the dignity and worthiness of his
character, however. Carelessness and lack of economy are
universally disapproved of—not as coming from a lack of
benevolence but from a lack proper attention to the objects
of self-interest.

Although the standard by which applied-ethics people
often decide what is right or wrong in human conduct is
whether a proposed action tends to the welfare or to the dis-
order of society, it doesn’t follow that a •concern for society’s
welfare is the sole virtuous motive for action—merely that in
any competition •it ought to outweigh all other motives.

Benevolence may perhaps be God’s only action-driver;
there are several not improbable arguments that tend to per-
suade us that it is so. It’s hard to conceive what other motive
can drive the actions of an independent and all-perfect Being
who has no need for anything external and whose happiness
is complete in himself. But be that as it may, man is an
imperfect creature whose existence needs to be supported

by many things external to him, and who must often act
from many other motives. Think about the affections that
ought—by the nature of our being—often to inﬂuence our
conduct, and ask youself ’Can such affections never appear
virtuous or deserve anyone’s commendation?’ How hard our
condition would be if that were so!
I have described three systems:

(1) the ones that place virtue in propriety,
(2) the ones that place virtue in prudence, and
(3) the ones that place virtue in benevolence.

Those are the principal accounts that have been given of the
nature of virtue. All the other descriptions of virtue ·that
philosophers have presented·, however different they may
look, are easily reducible to one of those three.

The system that places virtue in •obedience to the will of
the Deity can be counted among (2) or among (1). Consider
the question ‘Why ought we to obey the will of the Deity?’
This question would be impious and perfectly absurd if it
came from doubt about whether we ought to obey him; ·but
there is an acceptable role for the question to play, because·
it can admit of two different answers. We’ll have to say

(2) we ought to obey the will of the Deity because he is a
Being of inﬁnite power who will reward us eternally if
we do obey him and punish us eternally if we don’t; or
(1) independently of any concern for our own happiness
or for rewards and punishments of any kind, it is
ﬁtting that a creature should obey its creator, that
a limited and imperfect being should submit to one
whose perfections are inﬁnite and incomprehensible.
Those are the only two answers that we conceive to that
question. If (2) is the right answer then virtue consists in
prudence, or in the proper pursuit of our own ﬁnal interest
and happiness. . . . If (1) is the right answer, then virtue must
consist in propriety. . . .

158

Smith on Moral Sentiments

Licentious systems

The system that places virtue in utility belongs in (1).
According to this system, all the qualities of the mind that
are agreeable or advantageous to the person himself or
to others are approved of as virtuous, and the contrary
qualities disapproved of as vicious. And the agreeableness
or utility of any affection depends on its degree, i.e. on how
strongly or intensely the person has it. Every affection is
useful when it is conﬁned to a certain degree of moderation,
and every affection is disadvantageous when it exceeds
the proper bounds. According to this system, therefore,
virtue consists not in any one affection but in the proper
degree of all the affections. The only difference between this
and the system I have been working to establish is that it
makes utility—rather than sympathy, i.e. the corresponding
affection of the spectator—the natural and basic measure of
this proper degree.

Chapter 4: Licentious systems

All the systems I have presented assume that there is a real
and essential distinction between vice and virtue, whatever
these qualities may consist in. There is a real and essential
difference between (1) the propriety and impropriety of any
affection, between (3) benevolence and any other motive for
action, between (2) real prudence and shortsighted folly or
precipitate rashness. And all of them contribute to encourag-
ing praiseworthy dispositions and discouraging blameworthy
ones.

[Smith now gives the three a paragraph each in which
the system in question is criticised for not getting the moral
balance exactly right. This repeats things he has said already,
and is given here just to set the scene for what will come in
the next paragraph but one.]

Despite these defects, the general tendency of each of
those three systems is to encourage the best and most
laudable habits of the human mind; and it would be a good
thing for society if mankind in general (or even just the few
who claim to live according to some philosophical rule) were
to regulate their conduct by the precepts of any one of the
three. We may learn from each of them something that is
both valuable and peculiar. [Smith goes into details about
this, in praise of each of the three, with a special emphasis
on Epicurus. Then:]

There is, however, another system that seems to remove
entirely the distinction between vice and virtue, so that
its tendency is wholly pernicious; I mean the system of
Mandeville, ·presented in his book The Fable of the Bees; or
Private Vices, Public Beneﬁts·. [Mandeville died 26 years before the
present work was published.] Although this author’s opinions are
in almost every respect erroneous, some aspects of human
nature, when looked at in a certain way, seem at ﬁrst sight
to favour them. When they are described and exaggerated
by Mandeville’s lively and humorous though coarse and
rustic eloquence, they give his doctrines an air of truth and
probability that is apt to impose on the unskillful.

Mandeville regards anything done from a sense of propri-
ety, from a concern for what is commendable and praisewor-
thy, as being done from a love of praise and commendation—
or in his words ‘done from vanity’. Man, he observes,
is naturally much more interested in his own happiness
than in anyone else’s, and it is impossible for him ever to
prefer—really, in his heart—someone else’s prosperity to
his own. Whenever he appears to do so, we can be sure
that he is deceiving us, and acting from the same selﬁsh
motives as he does at all other times. One of the strongest of
his selﬁsh passions is vanity—he is always easily ﬂattered
and greatly delighted with the applause of those around

159

Smith on Moral Sentiments

Licentious systems

him. When he appears to sacriﬁce his own interests to
those of his companions, he knows that his conduct will
be highly agreeable to their self-love and that they won’t
fail to express their satisfaction by giving him extravagant
praises. He thinks that the pleasure he’ll get from this
outweighs the interest that he abandons in order to get it.
So •his conduct on this occasion is really just as selﬁsh, and
arises from just as mean a motive, as his conduct at any
other time. He is ﬂattered with the belief that •it is entirely
disinterested, and he ﬂatters himself with it too; because if
this were not supposed, his behaviour wouldn’t seem to him
or to anyone else to merit any commendation. So all public
spirit, all preference of public to private interest, is according
to Mandeville a mere cheat and imposition on mankind; and
the human virtue that is so much boasted of, and that is
the occasion of so much emulation among men, is the mere
offspring of pride impregnated by ﬂattery!

Can the most generous and public-spirited actions be re-
garded as in some sense coming from self-love? I shan’t try to
answer that now. The answer to it is no help in establishing
the reality—·or the non-reality·—of virtue, because self-love
can often be a virtuous motive for action.
I’ll only try to
show that (1) the desire to do what is honourable and noble,
to make ourselves proper objects of esteem and approval,
cannot with any propriety be called ‘vanity’. Even (2) the love
of well-grounded fame and reputation, the desire to acquire
esteem by what is really estimable, does not deserve that
name. (1) is the love of virtue, the noblest and best passion
in human nature.
(2) is the love of true glory, a passion
that in dignity appears to come just below the love of virtue.
[Smith describes the sort of person who is guilty of vanity:
someone who

•wants praise for qualities that don’t deserve as much
praise as he wants, or

•cares about fancy clothing and trivial bits of ‘elegant’
behaviour, or
•wants to be praised for something that he didn’t do,
or
•comes across as ‘important’ although he isn’t, or
•gets himself congratulated on adventures that in fact
he didn’t have, or
•claims to be the author of something he didn’t write;
that person really is vain in the proper sense of the word.
Also:]
(3) Someone is rightly said to be guilty of vanity if
he •isn’t contented with the silent sentiments of esteem
and approval, •is fonder of noisy acclamations than of the
sentiments themselves, •is never satisﬁed except when his
own praises are ringing in his ears, •tries really hard to get
external marks of respect, •is fond of titles, of compliments,
of being visited, of being attended, of being taken notice of in
public places with the appearance of deference and attention.
This trivial passion is entirely different from either of the
other two; it’s a passion of the lowest and least of mankind,
just as (1) and (2) are passions of the noblest and greatest.
But though these three passions—(1) the desire to make
ourselves proper objects of honour and esteem, i.e. to become
honourable and estimable, (2) the desire to acquire honour
and esteem by really deserving those sentiments, and (3) the
trivial desire for praise no matter how or why it comes—are
widely different; though two are always approved of while
the third never fails to be despised; there is a certain remote
afﬁnity among them; and that is what the humorous and
entertaining eloquence of this lively author has exaggerated
and used to deceive his readers. There is an afﬁnity between
(3) vanity and (2) the love of true glory, in that both these
passions aim at getting esteem and approval. But they are
different in this—(2) is a just, reasonable, and equitable
passion, while (3) is unjust, absurd, and ridiculous. The

160

Smith on Moral Sentiments

Licentious systems

man who wants to be esteemed for something that really
is estimable wants only what he is justly entitled to—you
would be wronging him by refusing it. Whereas a man who
wants esteem on any other terms is asking for something
that he has no just claim to. [Smith adds details about ways
in which the (3) person is sure to behave badly. Then:]

There is also an afﬁnity between (1) the desire to become
honourable and estimable and (2) the desire for honour
and esteem, between the love of virtue and the love of true
glory. They are alike in both aiming at being honourable
and noble, and also in a respect in which (2) the love of true
glory resembles (3) what is properly called vanity—namely
having some reference to the sentiments of others. The
man of the greatest magnanimity who (1) desires virtue for
its own sake and cares least about what mankind actually
think of him is still delighted with thoughts of what they
should think, with an awareness that though he may be
neither honoured nor applauded he is still a proper object of
honour and applause. . . . But there is still a great difference
between (1) and (2). . . . The man (1) who acts solely from
a concern for what is right and ﬁt to be done, a concern
for what is a proper object of esteem and approval even if
these sentiments are never bestowed on him, acts from the
most sublime and godlike motive that human nature is even
capable of conceiving. In contrast with that, the man (2) who
doesn’t just want to •deserve approval but is also anxious
to •get it, though he too is praiseworthy in the main, has
motives with a greater mixture of human inﬁrmity in them.
He risks being humiliated by the ignorance and injustice
of mankind, and his happiness is vulnerable to the envy of
his rivals and the folly of the public. The happiness of (1)
the other is altogether secure and independent of fortune,
and of the whims of those he lives with. If contempt and
hatred are thrown on him by the ignorance of mankind,

he isn’t humiliated because he regards this as not really
aimed at him. Mankind despise and hate him because they
If they
have a false notion of his character and conduct.
knew him better, they would esteem and love him. . . .
It
seldom happens, however, that human nature arrives at
this degree of ﬁrmness. Only weak and worthless people
are much delighted with •false glory, and yet by a strange
inconsistency •false disgrace is often capable of humiliating
those who appear the most resolute and determined.

Mandeville isn’t satisﬁed with representing the trivial
motive of vanity as the source of all the actions that are
commonly regarded as virtuous. He also tries to point out
many other respects in which human virtue is imperfect.
In every case, he claims, it falls short of the complete
self-denial that it lays claim to, and is commonly a mere
concealed indulgence of our passions rather than a victory
over them. He treats as gross luxury and sensuality any
relation to •pleasure except the most ascetic abstinence from
•it. He counts as a luxury anything that goes beyond what
is absolutely necessary for the support of human nature,
so that there is vice even in the use of a clean shirt, or of
a convenient place to live. He doesn’t morally distinguish
•lawful sexual relations between husband and wife from
•harmful ·and unlawful· gratiﬁcation of sexual desire; and he
sneers at a ‘temperance’ and a ‘chastity’ that can be practised
at so cheap a rate, ·i.e. the cheap rate of merely being married
to your sexual partner·. The ingenious sophistry of his
reasoning, is here, as on many other occasions, covered
by the ambiguity of language.
[Smith explains this at
considerable and slightly tangled length. When someone
has a disagreeable and offensive degree of the passion love of
sex, this disturbs and upsets people, which means that they
notice it and want to have a name for it; the chosen name
in English being ‘lust’. When someone has this desire in a

161

Smith on Moral Sentiments

Licentious systems

degree that doesn’t upset onlookers, they may completely
overlook it, and if they do want to talk about it they give
it a name that expresses the fact of its being kept down to
a moderate level, the name being ‘chastity’. Smith’s other
example is the love of pleasure, and the words ‘luxury’ for an
extreme degree of this passion and ‘temperance’ for the fact
that someone’s love of pleasure is suitably bounded. [That
was true of ‘luxury’ in his day, though not in ours.] Mandeville’s trick
has been to assume that ‘he is temperate’ means that he has
no love of pleasure, and that ‘he is chaste’ means that he
has no love of sex; and he claims to uncover the scandalous
fact that supposedly temperate people do have some love of
pleasure, and that supposedly chaste ones have some love of
sex. By proceeding in this way, Smith continues:] Mandeville
imagines that he has entirely demolished the reality of the
virtues of temperance and chastity. . . . But those virtues
don’t require that one be entirely numb to the objects of
the passions they try govern. They aim only at keeping the
violence of those passions below the level at which they might
harm the individual or disturb or offend society.

The great fallacy of Mandeville’s book is its representing

any passion that is

•vicious when it occurs with a certain intensity and
aims in a certain direction

as though it were

•vicious whenever it occurs with any degree of inten-
sity and whatever direction it aims in.

That’s how he goes about treating as vanity any passion that
involves any reference to the sentiments that other people do
have or ought to have; and it’s how he arrives at his favourite
conclusion, namely that ‘private vices are public beneﬁts’. If
the love of magniﬁcence, a taste

for the elegant arts and improvements of human
life, for whatever is agreeable in dress, furniture,

architecture, statuary, painting, and music

is to be regarded as ‘luxury’, ‘sensuality’, and ‘showing
off’, even in those whose are in a position to indulge those
passions without harming anyone else, then indeed luxury,
sensuality, and showing off are indeed public beneﬁts! That’s
because without the qualities to which Mandeville sees ﬁt to
give such nasty names, the arts of reﬁnement would have
no encouragement, and would eventually die for lack of
employment. The real foundation of this licentious system
was a set of popular ascetic doctrines that had been current
before Mandeville’s time and identiﬁed •virtue with •the
complete wiping out of all our passions. It was easy for him
to prove (1) that this entire conquest of all human passions
never happened, and (2) that if it did occur universally, that
would be pernicious to society because it would put an end
to all industry and commerce and—in a way—to the whole
business of human life. He used (1) to give himself the
appearance of proving that there is no real virtue, and that
what claimed to be virtue was a mere cheat and imposition
on mankind; and he used (2) to give himself the appearance
of proving that •private vices are public beneﬁts because
without •them no society could prosper or ﬂourish.

Such is the system of Mandeville, which ·was published
45 years ago and· once made so much noise in the world. It
may not have given rise to more vice than there would have
been without it; but it did at least encourage vice that arose
from other causes to appear more boldly and to proclaim
the corruptness of its motives with a bold openness that had
never been heard of before.

This system. . . .could never have imposed on so many
people, or given rise to such a general alarm among the
friends of better principles, if it hadn’t in some respects
bordered on the truth. ·I am not saying that no theory can
get widespread acceptance unless it is close to the truth·.

162

Smith on Moral Sentiments

Licentious systems

A theory in natural philosophy [here = ‘science’] may seem
plausible and be for a long time generally accepted, without
having any basis in nature or any sort of resemblance to the
truth. Descartes’s ‘vortices’ were regarded by a ingenious
nation, ·the French·, for nearly a century as a satisfactory
account of the revolutions of the heavenly bodies. Yet it
has been demonstrated to everyone’s satisfaction that these
supposed causes of those wonderful effects not only don’t
actually exist but are utterly impossible, and that if they
did exist they couldn’t produce the effects that Descartes
ascribed to them. But it’s not like that with systems of moral
philosophy. An author claiming to account for the origin of

our moral sentiments can’t deceive us so grossly, or depart
so far from all resemblance to the truth ·as did the Cartesian
theory of ‘vortices’·. When a traveller describes some distant
country, he can pass off groundless and absurd ﬁctions as
established matters of fact. But when someone offers to
inform us of •what is going on in our neighbourhood, and of
•the affairs of the parish that we live in, although he may get
us to accept many falsehoods (if we don’t take the trouble to
examine things with our own eyes), the greatest falsehoods
that he gets us to accept must have some resemblance to the
truth, and must even have a considerable mixture of truth
in them. . . .

Section 3: The different systems that have been formed concerning the source of approval

Introduction

After the inquiry into the nature of virtue, the next most
important question in moral philosophy concerns the source
of approval—the power or faculty of the mind that makes
certain characters agreeable or disagreeable to us, makes us
prefer one tenor of conduct to another, calling one ‘right’ and
the other ‘wrong’, and consider one as an object of approval,
honour, and reward and the other as an object of blame,
censure, and punishment.

Three accounts have been given of the generator of ap-
proval. Some people hold that we approve and disapprove
of actions—our own and other people’s—purely from (1)
self-love, i.e. from what we think about their tendency to
·lead to· our own happiness or disadvantage. Others say that
(2) reason—the faculty by which we distinguish truth from

falsehood—enables us to distinguish what is ﬁt from what is
unﬁt, both in actions and affections. According to yet others,
this distinction is wholly an effect of (3) immediate sentiment
and feeling, arising from the satisfaction or disgust that
certain actions or affections produce in us. So there they are,
the three different sources that have been assigned for the
principle [see note below] of approval: (1) self-love, (2) reason,
(3) sentiment.

Before I go on to describe those different systems, I
should remark that ﬁnding the right answer to this question,
though it’s very important for moral theory, has no practical
signiﬁcance. The question about the nature of virtue is
bound to have some inﬂuence on our notions of right and
wrong in many particular cases, but the question about the
principle of approval can’t possibly have any such effect. It’s

163

Smith on Moral Sentiments

Systems tracing approval back to self-love

only from philosophical curiosity that we try to discover what
the inner contrivance or mechanism is from which those
different notions or sentiments arise. [In the early modern period,
the word ‘principle’ was sometimes used with the meaning we have for
it, in which a principle is a proposition with a special status; but it was
much more often used to mean ‘source’ or ‘cause’ or ‘drive’—something
entirely non-propositional that brings about some event or state of affairs.
In the present version ‘principle’ is usually replaced by one of those other
words when it has been used in this early-modern sense—e.g. in the
heading of the present Section, where ‘principle’ has been replaced by
‘source’. We have just met an agreeably clear bit of evidence of how the
land lies: after saying that his topic is a question about the principle of
approval, Smith goes straight on to say that it’s an inquiry into the inner
contrivance or mechanism from which approval arises.]

Chapter 1: Systems that trace the source of
approval back to self-love

Those who explain approval as arising from self-love don’t
all account for it in the same manner, and all their different
systems contain a good deal of confusion and imprecision.
According to Hobbes and many of his followers—such as
Pufendorf and Mandeville—man is driven to take refuge in
society not by any natural love for his own kind but because
without the help of others he is incapable of surviving with
ease or safety. According to this theory, society becomes
necessary for a man, and anything that favours the support
and welfare of •society he regards as having an indirect
tendency to promote •his own interests; and anything that
is likely to disturb or destroy •society he regards as to some
extent harmful or pernicious to •himself. Virtue is the great
support of society, and vice its great disturber. That is why
virtue is agreeable to every man and vice is offensive to him;
he sees virtue as pointing to the prosperity of the society that

is so necessary for the comfort and security of his existence,
and vice as pointing to its ruin and disorder.

As I remarked earlier, there can be no doubt that virtue’s
tendency to promote the order of society and vice’s tendency
to disturb it reﬂects a great beauty in virtue and a great
ugliness in vice; and I mean that we get this sense of
beauty and ugliness when we consider this matter coolly
and philosophically—·i.e. setting aside the fact that we have
a stake in society’s surviving and ﬂourishing·. When we think
about human society in a certain abstract and philosophical
light, it appears like an immense machine whose regular and
harmonious movements produce countless agreeable effects.
As with any other beautiful and noble machine made by men,
whatever tends to make its movements smoother and easier
will derive a beauty from this effect, and whatever tends to
obstruct its movements will displease on that account. So
virtue, which is like the ﬁne polish to the wheels of society,
necessarily pleases; while vice, like the vile rust that makes
the wheels jar and grate on one another, is as necessarily
offensive. So this account of the origin of approval and
disapproval, to the extent that it derives them from a concern
for the order of society, turns into the account that gives
beauty to utility (I explained this earlier); and that’s the
source of all the plausibility that this ·Hobbes· system has.
When those authors

•describe the countless ways in which a cultivated and
social life is better than a savage and solitary one,
•go on about how virtue and good order are needed for
social life to survive, and
•demonstrate how certain it is that the prevalence of
vice and lawlessness tends to bring back the savage
life,

the reader is charmed with the novelty and grandeur of the
views that they open to him. He now clearly sees a beauty in

164

Smith on Moral Sentiments

virtue and an ugliness in vice that he hadn’t noticed before,
and is commonly so delighted with the discovery that he
doesn’t takes time to reﬂect that this political view, having
never occurred to him in his life before, can’t possibly be the
source of the approval and disapproval that he has always
been accustomed to give to virtue and vice.

When those authors derive from self-love our interest
in the welfare of society and the esteem that we therefore
give to virtue, they don’t mean that when we now applaud
the virtue of Cato and detest the villainy of Catiline our
sentiments are inﬂuenced by any thought of getting beneﬁt
from Cato or being harmed by Catiline!. . . . The Hobbesian
philosophers never imagined that when we applaud Cato and
blame Catiline we are inﬂuenced by some belief about how
the behaviour of those citizens of ancient Rome might cause
events that help or harm us now. Their view was rather
that these moral sentiments of ours are inﬂuenced by ·the
thought of· the help or harm we might have received if we
had lived at that time in that place, or by ·the thought of·
help or harm that might still come our way if we encounter
characters of the same kinds as Cato and Catiline. So
really the idea that those authors were groping for, but were
never able to get hold of ﬁrmly, was the idea of the indirect
sympathy that we feel with the gratitude or resentment
of those who received the beneﬁt or suffered the damage
resulting from such opposite characters. That is what they
were vaguely gesturing towards when they said that what
prompted our applause or indignation was not •the thought
of what we had gained or suffered but rather •the conception
or imagination of what we might gain or suffer if we were to
act in society with such associates.

But there is nothing selﬁsh about sympathy! When I
sympathize with your sorrow or your indignation, it may
be claimed that my emotion is based on self-love because

it arises from bringing your case home to myself, putting
myself in your situation, and in that way getting a sense
of what I would feel in those circumstances. But although
it’s true that sympathy arises from an imaginary change
of situations with the person principally concerned, this
imaginary change is not supposed to happen to

•me in my own person and character,

but to

•me in the character of the person with whom I
sympathize.

When I sympathize with you over the death of your only son,
in order to enter into your grief I don’t think about

•what I, a person of such-and-such a character and
profession, would suffer if I had an only son who died.

What I think about is rather

•what I would suffer if I were really you.

In this thought I don’t just switch your •circumstances with
mine; I change •persons and •characters. So my grief is
not in the least selﬁsh: it is entirely on your account, and
not in the least on my own. . . . A man may sympathize
with a woman in the labour of child-birth, but he can’t
possibly conceive himself —in his own proper person and
character—as suffering her pains. That whole account of
human nature, which

•derives all sentiments and affections from self-love,
which
•has made so much noise in the world, but which
•appears never yet to have been fully and clearly
explained,

seems to me to have arisen from some confused failure to
grasp what sympathy is.

Chapter 2: Systems that make reason the source of
approval

It is well known to have been Hobbes’s view that a state of
nature is a state of war; and that before civil government
was set up there could be no safe or peaceable society among
men. According to him, therefore, preserving society is
supporting civil government, and destroying civil government
was the same thing as putting an end to society. But the
existence of civil government depends on people’s obeying
the supreme magistrate [here = ‘the ruler’]. The moment he
loses his authority all government is at an end. So, Hobbes
concludes, because ·a desire for· self-preservation teaches
men to applaud whatever tends to promote the welfare of
society and to blame whatever is likely to harm it, that same
desire ought to teach them to applaud all instances of obedi-
ence to the civil magistrate and to blame all disobedience and
rebellion—it •ought to, and it •will if they think and speak
consistently. Thus, the ideas of laudable and blameworthy
ought coincide with the ideas of obedient and disobedient;
so the laws of the civil magistrate ought to be regarded as
the sole ultimate standards of what is just and unjust, right
and wrong.

It was Hobbes’s announced intention, in publishing these
notions, to bring men’s consciences immediately under the
civil powers—not the ecclesiastical powers, whose turbulence
and ambition he regarded as the principal source of the
disorders of society (he had been taught to think this by
the example of his own times, ·which covered the entire
Cromwellian revolution against Charles I·). This made his
doctrine especially offensive to theologians, who accordingly
vented their indignation against him with great ferocity and
bitterness.
It was also offensive to all sound moralists
because it supposed that there is no natural distinction

between •right and •wrong, that •these could be changed,
being dependent on what the civil magistrate chooses to
command. So Hobbes’s account of things was attacked from
all directions, and with all sorts of weapons, by sober reason
as well as by furious declamation.

In order to refute this odious doctrine it was necessary to
prove that in advance of any law or man-made institutions
the ·human· mind was naturally endowed with a faculty by
which it distinguished in certain actions and affections the
qualities of right, praiseworthy, and virtuous, and in others
those of wrong, blameworthy and vicious.

Cudworth in his Treatise concerning Eternal and Im-
mutable Morality rightly said that law couldn’t be the original
source of those distinctions, ·using the following argument·.
Suppose that there is a law: then either

(1) it is right to obey it and wrong to disobey it, or
(2) it makes no moral difference whether we obey it or
disobey it.

If (2) is correct, then there’s a law that obviously couldn’t be
the source of the distinction between right and wrong; and if
(1) is right, then this presupposes that there is a standard
for right and wrong independently of this law, a standard in
terms of which we can say that obedience to the law squares
with the idea of right, and disobedience squares with the
idea of wrong.

So the mind has a notion of those distinctions antecedent
to all law; and from this it seems to follow (·Cudworth
said·) that this notion was derived from reason, which
distinguishes right from wrong in the same way that it
distinguishes truth from falsehood. There is some truth
in this conclusion, though in some ways it is rather hasty. It
was easier to accept back then, when the abstract science
of human nature was still in its infancy, and the different
roles and powers of the different faculties of the human

166

Smith on Moral Sentiments

Systems making reason the source of approval

mind hadn’t yet been carefully examined and distinguished
from one another. [This could refer to Hume’s work; he published
his Treatise and both Enquiries in the 28 years between the publication
of that work of Cudworth’s and Smith’s writing of the present work.
(Cudworth’s book was ﬁrst published 43 years after his death.)] When
this controversy with ·the views of· Hobbes was being carried
on with such warmth and keenness, no-one had thought
of any other faculty from which such moral ideas could be
supposed to arise. And so at that time it was widely accepted
that the essences of virtue and vice consist not in conformity
or disagreement of human actions with •the law of a superior,
but in their conformity or disagreement with •reason, which
thereby came to be regarded as the original source and driver
of approval and disapproval.

That virtue consists in conformity to reason is true in
some respects, and reason can rightly considered as in some
sense the source and driver of approval and disapproval,
and of all solid judgments about right and wrong.
It is
by reason that we discover the general rules of justice by
which we ought to regulate our actions; and it is by reason
that we form the more vague and indeterminate ideas of
what is prudent, or decent, or generous or noble, which we
carry around with us, doing our best to model the tenor
of our conduct on them [see note on ‘tenor’ on page 85]. Like
all general maxims, the general maxims of morality are
based on experience and induction. We observe in a variety
of particular cases what pleases or displeases our moral
faculties,. . . .and by induction from this experience we set
up the general rules. And induction is always regarded
as an operation of reason. So it is right to say that we
derive from reason all those general maxims and ideas. ·This
is an important result, because· general maxims regulate
most of our moral judgments. Those judgments would be
extremely uncertain and precarious if they depended entirely

on something as variable as immediate sentiment and feeling,
which the different states of health and mood can alter so
essentially. Thus, our most solid judgments about right
and wrong are regulated by maxims and ideas derived from
an induction of reason; so it is correct to say that virtue
consists in conformity to reason, and we can go that far with
the thesis that reason is the source and driver of approval
and disapproval.

But ·that’s as far as we can go·; it is altogether absurd
and unintelligible to suppose that our ﬁrst ·or most basic·
perceptions of right and wrong can be derived from reason,
even in the particular cases on the basis of which we form
general moral rules. These ﬁrst perceptions can’t be an
object of reason; they must be matters of immediate sense
and feeling. (That holds true for all experiences on which
any general rules are based.) We form the general rules
of morality by ﬁnding in a vast variety of instances that
one tenor of conduct constantly pleases in a certain way
and that another constantly displeases. But reason can’t
make any particular object either agreeable or disagreeable
to the mind •for its own sake. Reason can show that
this object is a means to getting something else that is
naturally either pleasing or displeasing, and in this way
reason can make it either agreeable or disagreeable •for the
sake of something else. But nothing can be agreeable or
disagreeable for its own sake unless it is made to be so by
immediate sense and feeling. So if virtue in each particular
case necessarily pleases for its own sake, and if vice equally
certainly displeases the mind, then what reconciles us to
virtue and alienates us from vice can’t be reason; it has to
be immediate sense and feeling. [Smith now offers a short
paragraph in which he seems to lose track of what he wanted
to say. Its main point is to liken distinguishing virtue from
vice to distinguishing pleasure from pain.]

167

Smith on Moral Sentiments

Systems making sentiment the source of approval

But because reason can in a certain sense be regarded as
the source of •approval and disapproval, •these sentiments
were carelessly regarded as basically ﬂowing from the opera-
tions of reason; and that went on for a long time. Hutcheson
had the merit of being the ﬁrst who distinguished with any
degree of precision in what respect all moral distinctions may
be said to arise from reason, and in what respect they are
founded on immediate sense and feeling. In his illustrations
of the moral sense he has explained this so fully, and I think
so unanswerably, that any remaining controversy about the
subject must be due either to inattention to what Hutcheson
wrote or to a superstitious attachment to certain forms of
expression. . . .

Chapter 3: Systems that make sentiment the
source of approval

Systems that make sentiment the source of approval can be
divided into two classes.

(1) According to some writers, our approvals express a
sentiment of a special kind; we have a particular power
of perception that the mind employs when it encounters
certain actions or affections. Some of them have an agreeable
effect on this faculty, and they are given the labels ‘right’,
‘praiseworthy’, and ‘virtuous’. Others have a disagreeable
effect on the faculty, and are labelled ‘wrong’, ‘blameworthy’,
and ‘vicious’. These writers regard this sentiment as being of
a special nature distinct from every other, and as the effect
of a particular power of perception—·as distinct from any of
the others as the sense of sight is distinct from the sense
of hearing·—so they give it a name of its own and call it a
‘moral sense’.

(2) According to others, we can account for the business
of approving without having to suppose any new power of

perception that has never been heard of before. They think
that Nature acts here—as everywhere else—with the strictest
economy, producing a multitude of effects from a single
cause; and that all the effects ascribed to this peculiar faculty
of ‘moral sense’ can be explained in terms of sympathy, a
power that we obviously do have and that has always been
known and noticed.
[In the last paragraph of this chapter Smith
brieﬂy deals with (2); the rest of the chapter is all about (1).]

Hutcheson was at great pains to show that the approval
is not driven by self-love.
[Smith refers to Hutcheson’s Inquiry
concerning Virtue; for what he probably meant, see note on page 156.]
He demonstrated too that it couldn’t arise from any operation
of reason. The only remaining possibility, he thought, was
that approval is an exercise of a faculty of a special kind that
Nature has given to the human mind purely so as to produce
this one particular and important effect. With self-love and
reason ruled out, it didn’t occur to him that the desired
explanation might come from some other known faculty of
the mind.

He called this ·supposed· new power of perception a moral
sense, and thought it to be somewhat analogous to the
external senses. Just as the bodies around us, by affecting
our external senses in a certain way, appear to possess
the different qualities of sound, taste, odour, colour; so the
various affections of the human mind, by touching the moral
sense in a certain manner, appear to possess the different
qualities of likeable and odious, of virtuous and vicious, of
right and wrong.

According to this system, the various senses—or powers
of perception—from which the human mind derives all its
simple ideas are of two kinds: (1) the direct or antecedent
senses and (2) the reﬂex or consequent senses. (1) The direct
senses are the faculties through which the mind gets its
perceptions of qualities of things that don’t presuppose a

168

Smith on Moral Sentiments

Systems making sentiment the source of approval

previous perception of any other qualities. Thus sounds and
colours are objects of the direct senses. Hearing a sound
or seeing a colour doesn’t require us to perceive some other
quality or object ﬁrst. (2) The reﬂex or consequent senses
are the faculties through which the mind gets perceptions of
qualities of things that do presuppose a previous perception
of some other qualities. For example, harmony and beauty
are objects of the reﬂex senses: to perceive the harmony of a
sound or the beauty of a colour we must ﬁrst perceive the
sound or the colour. The moral sense was regarded as a
faculty of this kind. According to Hutcheson, the faculty that
Locke called ‘reﬂection’, from which he derived the simple
ideas of the passions and emotions of the human mind,
is (1) a direct internal sense. And the faculty by which we
perceive the beauty or ugliness—the virtue or vice—of those
passions and emotions is (2) a reﬂex internal sense.

Hutcheson tried to support this doctrine further by point-
ing out that it is agreeable to the analogy of nature, because
the mind does have a variety of other reﬂex senses exactly
similar to the moral sense. Examples: a sense of beauty
and ugliness in external objects; a public sense through
which we sympathize with the happiness or misery of our
fellow-creatures; a sense of shame and honour; a sense of
ridicule.

But despite all the trouble this philosopher put into
proving •his ‘moral sense’ theory,. . . .one of its admitted
consequences will strike many of us as ﬂatly refuting •it.
He accepts that it would be highly absurd to ascribe to
any •sense a quality belonging to •objects of that sense.
·He is right about this·: who ever thought of calling the
sense of sight ‘black’ or ‘white’, the sense of hearing ‘loud’
or ‘soft’, or the sense of tasting ‘sweet’ or ‘bitter’? Well,
according to Hutcheson it is equally absurd to say that our
moral faculties are ‘virtuous’ or ‘vicious’, ‘morally good’ or

169

‘morally evil’. These are qualities of the objects of those
faculties, not of the faculties themselves. Suppose we are
confronted by someone who is so absurdly constituted that
he approves of cruelty and injustice as the highest virtues,
and disapproves of fairness and humaneness as the most
pitiful vices. Such a constitution of mind might be regarded
as bad for the individual and bad for society, and also as
strange, surprising, and unnatural in itself; but—Hutcheson
contends—it could not without absurdity be called vicious
or morally evil.

But now suppose we see someone shouting with admira-
tion and applause at a barbarous and undeserved execution
that some insolent tyrant has ordered—we won’t think we
are guilty of any great absurdity in saying that this behaviour
is vicious and morally evil in the highest degree, although all
it expresses are •depraved moral faculties, or •an absurd
approval of this dreadful conduct. . . .
In such a case I
think we might for a while ignore our sympathy with the
victim and feel nothing but horror and detestation at the
thought of this dreadful spectator. We would abominate
him even more than we would the tyrant who ordered the
execution; he might have been goaded on by strong passions
of jealousy, fear, and resentment, which would make him
more excusable than the spectator. His sentiments seem
to be entirely without cause or motive, and therefore to be
perfectly and completely detestable. There’s no perversion
of sentiment or affection that our heart would. . . .reject with
greater hatred and indignation than one of this kind; and
so far from regarding such a constitution of mind as being
merely ‘strange’ or ‘unsuitable’ and not in any respect vicious
or morally evil, we would consider it rather as the last and
most dreadful stage of moral depravity.

Smith on Moral Sentiments

Systems making sentiment the source of approval

And on the other side of the ledger, correct moral senti-
ments naturally appear to be to some extent praiseworthy
and morally good.
If a man’s applause and censure are
always precisely suited to the value or unworthiness of
the object, he seems to deserve a certain amount of moral
approval for that. We admire the delicate precision of his
moral sentiments; they provide leadership for our own judg-
ments, and their uncommon and surprising justness arouses
our wonder and applause.
It’s true that we can’t always
be sure that this person’s conduct will match up to the
precision and accuracy of his judgments about the conduct
of others. Virtue requires •habit and •ﬁrmness of mind, as
well as •delicacy of sentiment; and unfortunately the former
qualities are sometimes lacking in people who have the latter
in the greatest perfection. Still, this disposition of mind,
although it may sometimes be accompanied by imperfections,
is incompatible with anything grossly criminal and is the
best foundation on which to build the superstructure of
perfect virtue. There are many men who mean well, and
seriously intend to do what they think is their duty, who
notwithstanding are disagreeable because of the coarseness
of their moral sentiments.
You may want to object:

Although the source of approval isn’t based on any
power of perception analogous to the external senses,
it may still be based on a special sentiment that serves
this one particular purpose and no other. Approval
and disapproval are •certain feelings or emotions
that arise in the mind when it sees or contemplates
characters and actions; and just as resentment might
be called ‘a sense of injuries’ and gratitude ‘a sense of
beneﬁts’, so •these feelings can properly be called ‘a
sense of right and wrong’ or ‘a moral sense’.

But this account of things, though not open to the same

objections as the previous account, is exposed to ·two· others
that are equally unanswerable.

(1) Whatever variations any speciﬁc kind of emotion may
undergo, it still preserves the general features that mark it off
as being of that kind; and these general features are always
more striking and noticeable than any variation which it
may undergo in particular cases. For example: anger is
an emotion of a speciﬁc kind, so that its general features
always stand out more clearly than all the variations it
undergoes in particular cases. Anger against a •man differs
somewhat from anger against a •woman, which differs from
anger against a •child. In each of those cases the general
passion of anger appears in a different version because of
the particular character of its object; you’ll easily see this if
you attend ·to what goes on in you when you are angry·. But
what predominate in all these cases are the general features
of the passion. To distinguish these you don’t need any
precise observation, whereas a delicate attention is needed if
one is to discover their variations; everyone is aware of the
general features, while hardly anyone notices the variations.
Well, then, if approval and disapproval were emotions of a
particular kind distinct from every other kind—in the way
gratitude and resentment are—we would expect that each
of them in all the variations it undergoes would still retain
the general features that mark it off as an emotion of that
particular kind, clear, plain, and easily distinguishable. But
that isn’t what happens. Attend to what you really feel on
different occasions when you approve of something. You’ll
ﬁnd that your emotion in one case is often totally different
from [Smith’s phrase] what it is in another, and that you can’t
ﬁnd any features that those particular emotional episodes
have in common. Your approval of a •tender, delicate, and
humane sentiment ·in someone else· is quite different from
your approval of sentiment that strikes you as •great, daring,

170

Smith on Moral Sentiments

Systems making sentiment the source of approval

and magnanimous. Your approval of each may be perfect
and entire; but you are •softened by one and •elevated by
the other, and there’s no sort of resemblance between the
emotions they arouse in you. This is bound to be the case if
my theory of the moral sentiments is true: the emotions of
the persons you approve of are different and indeed opposite
in those two cases; your approval arises from sympathy with
those opposite emotions; so of course what you feel on the
one occasion can’t have any resemblance to what you feel
on the other. But this couldn’t be right if approval consisted
in a special emotion that •is triggered by a view of some
sentiment in someone but •has nothing in common with that
sentiment. And all this can be re-applied to disapproval. Our
horror at cruelty has no resemblance to our contempt for
mean-spiritedness. When we encounter cruelty, the discord
we feel between our minds and the mind of cruel person is
quite different from the discord we feel between our mind
and the mind of someone who is mean-spirited.

(2) I would remind you of my earlier point that as well as

approving or disapproving of

•the different passions or affections of the human
mind that we encounter,

we also ﬁnd it natural to approve or disapprove of

•people’s approvals and disapprovals.

How can that be so if the theory now under investigation is
right? In fact, to the question

•How does it come about that we approve of proper
approvals and disapprove of improper approvals?

only one answer can possibly be given.
It is this: When
•you approve ·or disapprove· of •his conduct, your frame of
mind coincides with •mine; and so I approve of your approval
·or disapproval· and consider it as to some extent morally
good. And when •your approval ·or disapproval· creates
a mis-match between your frame of mind and my own, I

disapprove of •it and consider it as to some extent morally
evil. So it must be granted that at least in this one ·kind
of· case, ·where A (dis)approves of B’s (dis)approval of C·,
what constitutes A’s moral (dis)approval is the coincidence
or opposition between A’s sentiments and B’s. And if that’s
what (dis)approval amounts to in this one ·kind of· case,
why shouldn’t it be what it amounts to in every other? Why
imagine a new power of perception to account for those
sentiments?

Any account of approval that makes it depend on a special
sentiment distinct from every other is open to the following
objection: It is strange that this sentiment, which Providence
undoubtedly intended to be the governing force in human
nature, should have been overlooked to such an extent that
it doesn’t have a name in any language! The phrase ‘moral
sense’ is a recent invention and can’t yet be considered as
part of the English tongue. It was only a few years ago that
the word ‘approbation’ [= ‘approval’] was appropriated to mean
something of this kind. In propriety of language we approve
of whatever is entirely to our satisfaction, the form of a
building, the design of a machine, the ﬂavor of a dish of meat.
The word ‘conscience’ doesn’t immediately stand for any
moral faculty by which we approve or disapprove. Conscience
does presuppose the existence of •some such faculty, and
the word used properly signiﬁes our awareness that we have
acted agreeably or contrary to •its directions. When love,
hatred, joy, sorrow, gratitude, resentment—and so many
other passions that are all supposed to be governed by force
of (dis)approval—have made themselves considerable enough
to get labels, isn’t it surprising that the sovereign of them
all should have been so little noticed that no-one apart from
a few philosophers has thought it worthwhile to give it a
name?. . . .

171

Smith on Moral Sentiments

What different authors have said about the practical rules of morality

[Picking up now from paragraph (2) on page 168:] There’s another
system that tries to account for the origin of our moral
sentiments in sympathy, but not in the way that I have been
trying to establish. I have already given some account of it
in Part IV above. This is a system that places virtue in utility,
and explains the pleasure with which the spectator surveys
the utility of any quality in terms of •sympathy with the
happiness of those who get the beneﬁt of it. This is different

from the •sympathy by which we enter into the motives of
the benefactor and from the •sympathy by which we go along
with the gratitude of the beneﬁciaries. The causal story
here is like the story of what happens when we approve of
a well-designed machine. But no machine can be an object
of either of those two last mentioned sympathies—sympathy
with motives and sympathy with gratitude.

Section 4: What different authors have said about the practical rules of morality

I noted in Part III above [page 93] that the rules of justice
are the only rules of morality that are precise and detailed;
that the rules of all the other virtues are loose, vague, and
indeterminate. And I likened the rules of justice to rules
of grammar, and those of the other virtues to rules that
critics lay down for the achievement of what is sublime and
elegant in composition, presenting us with a general idea of
the perfection we ought to aim at rather than giving us any
certain and infallible directions for acquiring it.

Because the different rules of morality can differ so much
in their degrees of precision, authors wanting to collect and
digest them into systems have gone about this in two differ-
ent ways. (1) One set has followed through the whole loose
method that they were naturally directed to by considering
any one species of virtues. (2) The other set has universally
tried to introduce into their precepts the kind of precision
that only some of them are capable of. (1) have written like
critics, (2) like grammarians.

toc

172

(1) The ﬁrst group include all the ancient moralists, and
others. They have contented themselves with describing
the different vices and virtues in a general manner, and
with pointing out the ugliness and misery of one disposition
and the propriety and happiness of the other; they haven’t
pretended to lay down many precise rules that are to hold
good in all particular cases, with no exceptions. What they
have done are two things.
(a) They have tried to say, as
precisely as language will allow,

•what the sentiment of the heart is on which each
speciﬁc kind of virtue is founded—what sort of in-
ternal feeling or emotion constitutes the essence of
friendship, of humaneness, of generosity, of justice, of
magnanimity, and of all the other virtues; and •what
the sentiment of the heart is in the vices that are the
opposites of those virtues.

(b) And they have tried to say what is the general way of
acting—the ordinary tone and tenor of conduct—to which

Smith on Moral Sentiments

What different authors have said about the practical rules of morality

each of those sentiments would direct us, i.e. what kind of
conduct ordinarily goes with a person’s being friendly, or
generous, or brave, or just, or humane.

(a) Sketching the sentiment of the heart on which each
particular virtue is based requires a pencil that is both
delicate and precise, but it’s a task that can be carried out
with some degree of exactness. Of course it isn’t possible to
express all the variations that each sentiment either does
or ought to undergo according to every possible variation of
circumstances. The variations are endless, and language
lacks names for ·most of· them. Consider for example the
sentiment of friendship.

•The feeling of our friendship for an old man differs
from what we feel for a young man.
•The feeling of our friendship for an austere man differs
from what we feel for someone who has softer and
gentler manners.
•The feeling of our friendship for a gentle man differs
from what we feel for one who has cheerful vivacity
and spirit.
•The feeling of our friendship for a man differs from
what we feel for a woman, even when there is no
sexual feeling mixed in with it.

What author could list and describe these and all the other
inﬁnite varieties that friendship can undergo? Still, the
general sentiment of friendship and familiar attachment
that is common to them all can be pinned down precisely
enough. Although the picture that is drawn of it will always
be incomplete, it may provide enough of a likeness to enable
us to know the original when we meet with it, and even to
distinguish it from other sentiments that are considerably
like it, such as good-will, respect, esteem, admiration.

(b) To describe in a general way the way of acting to
which each virtue would ordinarily prompt us is even easier.

In fact it is hardly possible to (a) describe the internal
sentiment or emotion on which a virtue is based without
doing (b) something of this kind. It isn’t possible to express
in language the invisible features of all the different special
forms of a passion as they show themselves within. The
only way to mark them off from one another is by describing
the effects that they produce without—facial expression and
external behaviour, the resolutions they suggest, the actions
they prompt to. That is what led Cicero in Book 1 of his
Ofﬁces to direct us to the practice of the four cardinal virtues;
and led Aristotle in the practical parts of his Ethics to point
out to us the different habits by which he would have us
regulate our behaviour—habit such as those of liberality,
magniﬁcence, magnanimity. . . .

Such works present us with nice lively pictures of man-
ners. Their liveliness stirs up our natural love of virtue, and
increases our hatred of vice; by the rightness and delicacy
of their observations they can help to correct. . . .our natural
sentiments concerning the propriety of conduct,. . . .helping
us to get our behaviour more exactly right, by standards
that we might not have thought of without such instruction.
This treatment of the rules of morality is the science that is
properly called ‘Ethics’—a science that •can’t be done with
great precision (it’s like criticism in that respect) but that •is
nevertheless highly useful and agreeable. It is more open
than any other science to using the ornaments of eloquence,
through which it gives even the smallest rules of duty a
new importance. Its precepts, thus adorned, can produce
noble and lasting impressions on young people, getting them
while they are young enough to be ﬂexible. . . . Anything that
precept and exhortation [= roughly ‘commanding and pleading’] can
do to spur us to the practice of virtue is done by this science
delivered in this way. [That completes (1), started on page 172.]

What different authors have said about the practical rules of morality

(2) The second set of moralists •don’t content themselves
with characterizing in this general manner the tenor of
conduct that they want to recommend to us, but •work
to lay down exact and precise rules to govern every detail of
our behaviour. This group includes:

(a) All the casuists [= ‘applied-ethics theorists’] of the middle

and latter ages of the Christian church, as well as

(b) All those who, during those times or in the century
just past, have written about ‘natural jurisprudence’,
as they call it.

Because justice is the only virtue for which such exact
rules can properly be given, it’s the one that has had most
consideration from both of those sub-groups of writers. But
they treat it very differently.

(b) Those who write about the principles of jurisprudence
attend only to what the person to whom the obligation is
due ought to think he is entitled to get by force—what every
impartial spectator would approve of him for getting in that
way, or what a duly appointed judge or arbiter ought to
(a) The casuists
require the other person to allow or do.
attend less to

•what one can properly use force to get from someone

than to

•what the person who owes the obligation ought to
think himself bound to perform because of a sacred
and scrupulous regard for the general rules of justice,
and of a conscientious fear of wronging his neighbour
or of violating the integrity of his own character.

What jurisprudence is for is to prescribe rules for the de-
cisions of judges and arbiters. What casuistry is for is to
prescribe rules for the conduct of a good man. If the rules
of jurisprudence were perfectly complete, and if we always
obeyed them all, what would we then deserve? Nothing
but •freedom from external punishment! But if the rules

of casuistry were such as they ought to be, and we always
obeyed them all, the exact and scrupulous delicacy of our
behaviour would entitle us to •considerable praise.

It can happen that a good man ought to think himself
bound by a sacred and conscientious respect for the general
rules of justice to do something that it would be utterly
unjust to extort from him, or for any judge or arbiter to
impose on him by force. A trite example: a traveller is obliged
by his fear of death to promise a certain sum of money to
a highwayman. Should a promise that is in this manner
extorted by unjust force be regarded as obligatory? That
question has been much debated.

If we take it merely as a question of jurisprudence, the
answer is obvious: it would be absurd to suppose that the
highwayman can be entitled to use force to constrain the
traveller to keep his promise. Extorting the promise was a
crime that deserved severe punishment, and extorting the
promise-keeping would only be adding a second crime to the
ﬁrst. . . . It would be a ridiculous absurdity to suppose that a
judge ought to enforce the keeping of such promises, or that
the magistrate [here = ‘the legal system’] ought to allow actions
at law concerning them. So if we consider this question as a
question in jurisprudence, the answer is easy.

But if we understand it rather as a question in casuistry,
it isn’t so easily answered. Consider a good man who
has a conscientious regard for the sacred rule of justice
commanding that all serious promises be kept: will he think
himself obliged to keep his promise to the highwayman?
There really is a question about this. Everyone will agree
that

•this good man isn’t obliged to care about the disap-
pointment of the wretch who brought him into this
situation, that

174

Smith on Moral Sentiments

What different authors have said about the practical rules of morality

•no injury is done to the robber ·by the promise’s not
being kept·, and consequently that
•payment of the promise can’t be extorted by force.

·That stops jurisprudence from ruling that the promise
should be kept, but casuistry may still have something to
say·. It may be the case that

•this good man owes some respect to his own dignity
and honour, to the inviolable sacredness of the part
of his character that makes him reverence the law of
truth and hate everything that smacks of treachery
and falsehood.

It’s not obvious that this is false; and the casuists are
greatly divided about such cases. On one side there are
those who unhesitatingly say that no sort of regard is due
to any such promise, and that to think otherwise is mere
weakness and superstition. Cicero was one of these, among
the ancients, and Pufendorf among the moderns. Also, above
all, Hutcheson, who in most cases was by no means a loose
·or unduly permissive· casuist. On the other side are some
of the ancient fathers of the church (e.g. Augustine) as well
as some eminent modern casuists; they judge that all such
promises are obligatory.

If we bring the common sentiments of mankind to bear
on the question, we get the answer that some regard is due
even to a promise of this kind, but that it’s impossible to
determine how much by any general rule that will apply to
all cases without exception. A man who is quite frank and
easy in making promises of this kind, and who violates them
quite casually, is not someone we would choose as a friend
and companion. A gentleman who promised a highwayman
ﬁve pounds and didn’t pay would incur some blame. But if
the promised sum was very large, it might be more doubtful
what was the right thing to do. Suppose that keeping the
promise would entirely ruin the family of the promiser, or

175

that the sum was large enough be sufﬁcient for promoting
the most useful purposes, then it would seem to be in some
measure criminal, or at least extremely improper, to put it
into such worthless hands merely for the sake of a punctilio
[= ‘a nit-picking point in morals’]. A man who beggared himself,
or one who threw away a hundred thousand pounds (even
if he could afford that vast sum) so as to keep his word to
a thief would appear to the common sense of mankind to
be utterly absurd and extravagant. Such profusion would
seem inconsistent with his duty—with what he owed both
to himself and to others. . . . But it’s obviously impossible to
lay down any precise rule saying how much respect should
be had for such a promise, or what the greatest sum is that
could be owing because of it. This would vary according to

—the characters of the persons,
—their circumstances,
—the solemnity of the promise, and
—what in detail happened in the hold-up on the highway.
·Regarding that last item·: If the promiser had been treated
with a great deal of the sort of elaborate politeness that is
sometimes to be met with in really bad people, the promise
would seem to have more force than it would otherwise have
had. It may be said in general that

exact propriety requires that all such promises should
be kept, except when that would be inconsistent
with some other duties that are more sacred, such
as •regard for the public interest, •regard for those
who should be provided for out of gratitude, natural
affection, or respect for the laws of proper beneﬁcence.
But, I repeat, we have no precise rules to determine what
actions such motives require or, therefore, to determine when
those virtues are inconsistent with keeping such promises.
that whenever such

promises are broken—even if

We should remember,

though,

Smith on Moral Sentiments

What different authors have said about the practical rules of morality

reasons—that will always bring some degree of dishonour to
the person who made them. After they are made, we may
be convinced that it would be wrong to keep them, but still
there is some fault in having made them ·in the ﬁrst place·.
It is, at least, a departure from the highest and noblest
maxims of magnanimity and honour; a brave man ought to
die rather than make a promise that it would be foolish to
keep and disgraceful to break. For some degree of disgrace
always accompanies a situation of this kind. Treachery
and falsehood are vices so dangerous, so dreadful, and at
the same time so •easy to practice and often so •safe, that
we are more protective concerning them than concerning
almost any other. So our imagination attaches the idea of
shame to all violations of faith, in every circumstance and in
every situation. In this respect they resemble the violations
of chastity in the fair sex, a virtue of which (for the same
reasons) we are excessively protective; and our sentiments
concerning female chastity are not more delicate than our
sentiments concerning the breaking of promises. A breach
of chastity dishonours the woman irretrievably. No details
of the case. . . .can excuse it; no sorrow or repentance can
atone for it. We are so hard to satisfy in this respect that
even a rape dishonours ·the victim·: in our imagination the
innocence of her mind can’t wash out the pollution of her
body.
It is just like that with breaking one’s word when
it has been solemnly pledged, even if it was to the most
worthless of mankind. Fidelity [here = ‘promise-keeping’] is such
a necessary virtue that we see it as being in general due even
to those to whom nothing else is due, and whom we think
it lawful to kill and destroy. The culprit may plead that he
promised only in order to save his life, and that he broke
his promise because keeping it would be inconsistent with
some other respectworthy duty; these facts may alleviate his
dishonour but they can’t entirely wipe it out. He appears

to have been guilty of an action that has some degree of
shame inseparably connected with it in the imaginations of
men, He has broken a promise that he had solemnly said
he would keep; and his character, if not irretrievably stained
and polluted, at least has afﬁxed to it a ridicule that it will be
difﬁcult to get rid of entirely. No man who had gone through
an adventure of this kind would be fond of telling the story!
This example may serve to show how casuistry differs
from jurisprudence, even when both are dealing with the
obligations of the general rules of justice.

But though this difference is real and essential, though
those two sciences have quite different purposes, the same-
ness of their subject-matter has made them alike—so much
so that most authors who announce that they are doing
jurisprudence raise various questions of which they answer
some according to the principles of jurisprudence and oth-
ers according to those of casuistry, without distinguishing
them and perhaps without even being aware of this switch
whenever it occurs.

But casuistry is by no means conﬁned questions about
what would be demanded of us by a conscientious respect
for the •general rules of justice. It also takes in many •other
parts of Christian and moral duty. What seems principally
to have led to the development of casuistry was the custom
of spoken confession, introduced by the Roman Catholic
superstition in times of barbarism and ignorance. By that
institution everyone’s most secret actions and even thoughts
that could be suspected of veering away ever so slightly
from the rules of Christian purity were to be revealed to the
confessor. The confessor told his penitents whether and how
they had violated their duty, and what penance they would
have to undergo before he could absolve them in the name
of the offended Deity.

176

Smith on Moral Sentiments

What different authors have said about the practical rules of morality

The consciousness of having done wrong, or even the
suspicion of it, is a load on every mind; and it is accompanied
by anxiety and terror in everyone who isn’t hardened by long
habits of wickedness. Here as in all other distresses men are
naturally eager to unburden themselves of the oppression
they feel on their thoughts, by revealing the agony of their
mind to someone whose secrecy and discretion they can trust
in. The shame they suffer from this acknowledgment is fully
compensated for by the lessening of their uneasiness that
nearly always comes from the sympathy of their conﬁdant,
·the confessor·. They get relief from the discovery that they
are not entirely unworthy of respect; and that however their
past conduct may be censured, their present disposition is
approved of and may be sufﬁcient to make up for the past, or
at least to bring them some degree of esteem from their friend,
·the confessor·. In those times of superstition a numerous
and skillfully contriving clergy insinuated themselves into the
conﬁdence of almost every private family. [Smith continues
at some length describing the priests as cunningly working
themselves into the position of accepted moral authorities.
Then:] To qualify themselves as confessors thus became a
necessary part of the study of churchmen and divines; and
that led them to collect what are called ‘cases of conscience’,
difﬁcult and delicate situations where it is hard to decide
what is the right thing to do. Such collections, they imagined,
might be useful to the directors of consciences and to those
who were to be directed; and that is how books of casuistry
were started.

The casuists mainly dealt with moral duties of which it is

true that

•they can at least to some extent be covered by general
rules, and
•the violation of them is naturally followed by some
degree of remorse and some fear of punishment.

The institution that gave rise to their works—·namely,
confession·—was designed soothe the terrors of conscience
that come with the infringement of such duties. But one can
fall short in some virtues without any severe moral worries
of this kind; no-one applies to his confessor for absolution
because he didn’t do the most generous, the most friendly,
or the most magnanimous thing that could possibly have
been done in his circumstances. The rule that is violated
in failures of this kind is usually not determinate, and—a
second point—is generally of such a kind that although one
might be entitled to honour and reward for obeying it, one
isn’t exposed to positive blame, censure, or punishment if
one violates it. The exercise of virtues of that kind seems
to have been regarded by the casuists as a sort of work
of supererogation, which couldn’t be strictly demanded
and which therefore didn’t have to be discussed by them.
[‘Supererogation’ is still a standard English word, if not a very common
one. A supererogatory act is one that goes beyond the call of duty, one
that it is praiseworthy to perform and not blameworthy to not-perform.]
The breaches of moral duty that did come before the
tribunal of the confessor, and on that account came within
the s cope of the casuists, were chieﬂy of three kinds.

(1) Breaches of the rules of justice. These rules are all
explicit, ﬁrm, and deﬁnite, and violating them naturally
brings an •awareness of deserving and a •fear of suffering
punishment from both God and man.

(2) Breaches of the rules of chastity. In all the grosser
instances these are real breaches of the rules of justice, and
no-one can be guilty of them without doing unpardonable
harm to someone else.
In lesser instances, where the
breaches amount only to violations of the exact rules of
conduct that ought to be observed in relations between
the two sexes, they aren’t violations of the rules of justice.
Still, they are generally violations of a pretty plain rule, and

177

Smith on Moral Sentiments

What different authors have said about the practical rules of morality

they tend, in at least one of the sexes, •to bring disgrace
on the person who has been guilty of them and thus to
•be accompanied attended in scrupulous people with some
degree of shame and remorse.

(3) Breaches of the rules of veracity. Although the vio-
lation of truth is often a breach of justice, it isn’t always
so, which is why such violations can’t always expose the
person to any external punishment. The vice of ordinary
everyday lying, though a miserable meanness, often doesn’t
harm anyone; and in those cases no-one can claim to have a
right of revenge or a right to compensation. But the violation
of truth, though not always a breach of justice, is always a
breach of a plain rule, and it naturally tends to bring shame
on the person who is guilty of it.
·AN ASIDE ON TRUTHFULNESS·

Young children seem to have an instinctive disposition to
believe whatever they are told. Nature seems to have judged
it necessary for their survival that they should, for a while at
least, have complete conﬁdence in the people who entrusted
with the care of their childhood and of the earliest and most
necessary parts of their education. So they are excessively
credulous, and it requires long experience of the falsehood
of mankind to reduce them to a reasonable degree of caution
and distrust. In adults the degrees of credulity are clearly
different. The wisest and most experienced are generally the
least credulous. But there’s hardly a man alive who isn’t
more credulous than he ought to be, and who doesn’t often
believe tales that not only •turn out to be perfectly false but
also •could have been spotted as false through a quite small
amount of reﬂection and attention. One’s natural disposition
is always to believe. Only through acquired wisdom and
experience do we learn incredulity, and we don’t often learn
enough. The wisest and most cautious of us often accepts
stories that he himself is afterwards both ashamed and

astonished that he could possibly think of believing.

The man we believe is our leader and director in the
matters concerning which we believe what he tells us, and
we look up to him with a certain amount of esteem and
respect. But just as we move from admiring other people to
wanting to be admired ourselves, so also we move from being
led and directed by other people to wanting to be leaders and
directors ourselves. And just as we can’t always be satisﬁed
merely with being admired unless we can persuade ourselves
that we are to some extent really worthy of admiration, so
also we can’t always be satisﬁed merely with being believed
unless we are aware that we are really worthy of belief. Just
as the desire for praise and the desire for praiseworthiness
are (though closely related) distinct and separate desires, so
also the desire to be believed and the desire to be worthy
of belief are (though closely related) equally distinct and
separate desires.

The desire to be believed—the desire to persuade, lead
and direct other people—seems to be one of the strongest
of all our natural desires. It may be the instinct on which
the faculty of speech is based. . . . No other animal has this
faculty, and we can’t ﬁnd in any other animal any desire
to lead and direct the judgment and conduct of its fellows.
Great ambition—the desire for real superiority, the desire to
lead and direct—seems to be exclusive to man; and speech
is the great instrument of ambition—of real superiority, of
leading and directing the judgments and conduct of other
people.

It is always humiliating not to be believed, and it is doubly
so when we suspect that the reason we aren’t believed is that
we are regarded as •unworthy of belief and as •capable of
seriously and deliberately deceiving. To tell a man that he
lies is the gravest of all insults. Yet anyone who seriously and
deliberately deceives others must be aware that he deserves

178

Smith on Moral Sentiments

What different authors have said about the practical rules of morality

this insult, that he doesn’t deserve to be believed, and that
he is giving up any claim to the sort of trust that he needs
if he is to have any sort of ease, comfort, or satisfaction in
the society of his equals. A man who had the misfortune to
imagine that nobody believed a single word he said would
feel himself an outcast from human society, would dread the
thought of going into it, or of presenting himself before it;
and I think he would probably die of despair. But it is likely
that no man ever had good reason to have this belief about
his situation. The most notorious liar, I’m inclined to think,
tells the truth at least twenty times for once that he seriously
and deliberately lies; and just as in the most cautious people
the disposition to believe is apt to prevail over the disposition
to doubt and distrust, so also in those who care least about
truth the natural disposition to tell it usually prevails over
the disposition to deceive, or in any way to alter or disguise
it.

We are humiliated when we happen to deceive other
people, even though it was unintentional and a result of
having been deceived ourselves. Although this involuntary
falsehood is often not a sign of any lack of truthfulness—of
any lack of the most perfect love of truth—it is always to
some extent a sign of •lack of judgment, of failure of memory,
of •improper credulity, of •some degree of impulsiveness and
rashness. It always lessens our authority to persuade, and
always casts some doubt on our ﬁtness to lead and direct.
Still, the man who sometimes misleads because he has made
a mistake is very different from the one who is capable of
wilfully deceiving. The former may safely be trusted on many
occasions, the latter almost never.

Frankness and openness win conﬁdence. We trust the
man who seems willing to trust us. We see clearly, we think,
the road along which he means to lead us, and we are glad
to give ourselves over to his guidance and direction. Reserve

and concealment, on the other hand, call forth unconﬁdence.
We’re afraid to follow a man who is going we-don’t-know-
where. Also, what makes conversation and society such
a pleasure is a certain correspondence of sentiments and
opinions, a certain harmony of minds that blend and keep
time with one another like musical instruments. But this
delightful harmony can’t be obtained unless there is a free
communication of sentiments and opinions. So we all want
to feel how each other is affected, to penetrate into each
others’ bosoms and observe the sentiments and affections
that really exist there. The man who co-operates with us in
this natural passion, who invites us into his heart,. . . .seems
to offer a kind of hospitality that is more delightful than any
other. [Smith goes on at rather laborious length about •the
pleasures of open-hearted communication, •the dangers of
going too far and prying into things that others want to keep
private, •the unpleasantness of a person who repels all our
attempts to get to know him, •the strengths and dangers
of being temperamentally reserved and secretive, and •the
upsettingness of learning that one has innocently passed
along a falsehood. He works a few mentions of the casuists
into all this, and eventually returns to them as his main
topic, with a quick recapitulation:]

So the chief topics of the writings of the casuists were

these:

(1) the conscientious respect that should be paid to the
rules of justice; how far we ought to respect the life
and property of our neighbour; the duty of restitution;
(2) the laws of chastity and modesty, and what consti-
tuted the ‘sins of concupiscence’, as they called them
[= ‘sins involving an immoderate desire for worldly things’];

(3) the rules of veracity, and the obligation of oaths,

promises, and contracts of all kinds.

The casuists in their works tried to take things that only

179

Smith on Moral Sentiments

What different authors have said about the practical rules of morality

•feeling and sentiment can judge of, and to direct them by
•precise rules—tried and failed! How could one ascertain by
rules

•the exact point at which in any given case a delicate
sense of justice begins to turn into a trivial and weak
fussiness of conscience?
•when secrecy and reserve begin to grow into dissimu-
lation?
•how far an agreeable irony can be carried, and at what
precise point it begins to degenerate into a detestable
lie?
•what is the highest pitch of freedom and ease of
behaviour that can be regarded as graceful and be-
coming, and when does it start to turn into a negligent
and thoughtless licentiousness?

With regard to all such matters, what would be right in one
case would hardly be exactly right in any other, and what
constitutes behaving in a fully satisfactory way varies from
case to case because of tiny differences in the situations.
Books of casuistry, therefore, are generally as useless as
they are commonly tiresome. They couldn’t give much help
to anyone who consulted them occasionally, even if their
decisions were always right, because it is so unlikely that
a casuist author will have considered cases exactly parallel
to the one he is now being consulted about. Someone who
is really anxious to do his duty must be weak if he thinks
he has much use for works of casuistry; and as for someone
who doesn’t care much about his duty, the style of those
writings makes them unlikely to awaken him to care more.
None of them tend to animate us to what is generous and
noble. None of them tend to soften us to what is gentle
and humane. Many of them, on the contrary, tend rather
to teach us to logic-chop with our own consciences, and
by their vain subtleties serve to authorize countless evasive

reﬁnements concerning the most essential articles of our
duty. The frivolous precision that they tried to introduce into
subjects that don’t admit of it was almost certain to betray
them into those dangerous errors; and at the same time it
made their works dry and disagreeable, full of abstruse and
metaphysical distinctions, but unable to arouse in the heart
any of those emotions that it is the principal use of books of
morality to arouse.

[In preparation for this paragraph, recall that Smith has identiﬁed
three kinds of writings on morality, to which he gives the labels ‘ethics’,
‘casuistry’ and ‘jurisprudence’.] The two useful parts of moral
philosophy, therefore, are Ethics and Jurisprudence; Casu-
istry ought to be rejected altogether. •The ancient moralists
appear to have judged much better ·than did the mediaeval
and modern casuists·. When •they treated those same
subjects they didn’t make a parade of minute exactness,
but settled for describing in a general way the sentiments
on which justice, modesty, and veracity are founded, and
the ordinary ways of acting to which those virtues would
commonly prompt us.

[Some ancient philosophers did produce what looks like
casuistry, Smith admits; he mentions Book 3 of Cicero’s
Ofﬁces. But he says that they weren’t attempting any sort
of completeness, and were only illustrating situations where
there is a question as to whether the ordinary rules of duty
should be adhered to.]

Every system of man-made law can be seen as a more or
less imperfect attempt at a system of natural jurisprudence,
or at an enumeration of the particular rules of justice.
Because the violation of •justice is something men will never
submit to from one another, the public magistrate [see note
on page 44] has to use the power of the commonwealth to
enforce the practice of this •virtue. If this were not done,
civil society would become a scene of bloodshed and disorder,

180

Smith on Moral Sentiments

What different authors have said about the practical rules of morality

with every man getting his own private revenge whenever he
fancied he had been harmed. To prevent the confusion that
would come with every man’s •seeking justice for himself,
the magistrate in any government that has acquired any
considerable authority undertakes to •provide justice for
everyone, and promises to hear and to redress every com-
plaint of injury. In all well-governed states, as well as judges
being appointed to settle the controversies of individuals,
rules are laid down to regulate the decisions of those judges;
and these rules are generally intended to coincide with the
rules of natural justice. Not that they actually always do
so. •It sometimes happens that the man-made laws of a
country are wrenched away from what natural justice would
prescribe—sometimes by the so-called ‘constitution’ of the
state, i.e. the interests of the government; and sometimes
by the interests of particular groups of men who tyrannize
the government. •In some countries, the crudeness and
barbarism of the people prevent the natural sentiments of
justice from reaching the accuracy and precision that they
naturally attain to in more civilized nations. Their laws are,
like their manners, gross and crude and undistinguishing
[Smith’s word].
•In other countries where the people are
civilized enough to sustain a disciplined regular system of
jurisprudence, no such system becomes established because
the unfortunate structure of their legal system blocks it.
•In no country do the decisions of man-made law coincide,
exactly and in every case, with the rules that the natural
sense of justice would dictate. So systems of man-made law,
though they deserve the greatest authority, as the records
of mankind’s sentiments in different ages and nations, can’t
ever be seen as accurate systems of the rules of natural
justice.

One might have expected that lawyers’ reasonings about
the various imperfections and improvements of the laws of

various countries would give rise to an inquiry into what are
the natural rules of justice independently of all man-made
institutions. One might have expected that these reasonings
would lead the lawyers to aim at establishing a system of
natural jurisprudence properly so-called, a theory of the gen-
eral principles that ought to permeate and be the foundation
of the laws of all nations. Well, the reasonings of lawyers
did produce something of this kind; and everyone who has
systematically treated the laws of any particular country has
mixed into his work many observations of this sort; but it was
late in the world before any such general system was thought
of, and before the philosophy of law was addressed on its
own and without reference to the particular institutions of
any one nation. In none of the ancient moralists, do we ﬁnd
any attempt at a detailed list of the rules of justice. Cicero in
his Ofﬁces and Aristotle in his Ethics discuss •justice in the
same general manner in which they discuss •all the other
virtues.
In the laws of Cicero and Plato, where we might
naturally have expected some attempts at a list of the rules
of natural equity—rules that ought to be enforced by the
man-made laws of every country—there is nothing of this
kind. Their laws are laws of policy, not of justice. Grotius
seems to have been the ﬁrst to try to give the world anything
like a system of the principles that ought to permeate and
be the foundation of the laws of all nations; and his treatise
on the laws of war and peace, with all its imperfections, is
perhaps the most complete work that has so far been given
on this subject. In another work I shall try to give an account
of the general principles of law and government and of the
different revolutions they have gone through in the different
ages and periods of society, not only in relation to justice but
also in relation to policy, taxation, and arms, and whatever
else is the object of law.
